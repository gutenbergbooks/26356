<h2>A BROTHER TO DRAGONS.</h2>


<h3><br />I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the year of grace, 1586, on the last
day of the month of May, to all who may
chance to read this narrative, these:</p>

<p>I will first be at the pains of stating
that had it not been for Marian I had
never indited these or any other papers,
true or false. Secondly, that the facts herein
set down be true facts; none the less
true that they are strange. I will furthermore
explain that Marian is the Christian
name of my lawful wife, and that our surname
is Butter.</p>

<p>My wife had nursed the Lady Margaret
from the moment of her birth; and here I
must make another digression. The Lady<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Margaret was the twin sister of the then
Lord of Amhurste, Lord Robert, and my
lady and his lordship had quarrelled&mdash;Marian
saith, with a great cause, but I cannot
herein forbear also expressing my opinion,
which is to the effect that for that quarrel
there was neither cause, justice, nor reason.
Therefore, before those who may
chance to read these words, I will lay bare
the facts pertaining to the said quarrel.</p>

<p>It concerned the family ghost, which
ghost was said to haunt a certain blue
chamber in the east wing of the castle.
Now I myself had never gainsaid these
reports; for although I do not believe in
ghosts, I have a certain respect for them, as
they have never offered me any affront, either
by appearing to me or otherwise maltreating
me. But Marian, who like many
of her sex seemed to consort naturally with
banshees, bogies, apparitions, and the like,
declared to me that at several different and
equally inconvenient times this ghost had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
presented itself to her, startling her on two
occasions to such an extent that she once
let fall the contents of the broth-bowl on
Herne the blood-hound, thereby causing that
beast to maliciously devour two breadths of
her new black taffeta Sunday gown; again,
a hot iron wherewith she was pressing out
the seams of Lady Margaret's night-gown.
On the second occasion, she fled along the
kitchen hall, shrieking piteously, and preceded
by Doll, the kitchen wench, the latter
having in her seeming a certain ghostly appearance,
as she was clad only in her shift,
which the draughts in the hall inflated to a
great size. The poor maid fled affrighted
into her room and locked the door behind
her; yet when I did essay to assuage the
terror of Mistress Butter, identifying Doll
and the blue-room ghost as one and the
same, she thanked me not, but belabored
me in her frenzy with the yet warm iron,
which she had instinctively snatched up in
her flight; demanding of me at the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
time if I had ever seen Doll's nose spout
fire, and her eyes spit in her head like hot
coals. I being of a necessity compelled to
reply "No," Marian further told me that it
was thus that the ghost had comported itself;
that, moreover, it was clad all in a livid
blue flame from top to toe, and that it had
a banner o' red sarcenet that streamed out
behind like forked lightning. She then
said that this malevolent spirit had struck
her with its blazing hand, and that, did I
not believe her, I could see the burn on
her wrist. Upon my suggesting that this
wound might have been inflicted by the
iron in its fall, she did use me in so unwifely
a manner that I sought my bed in
much wrath and vexation of spirit. Nay,
I do fear me that I cursed the day I was
wed, the day on which my wife was born,
wishing all women to the d&mdash;l; and that,
moreover, out loud, which put me to much
shame afterwards for some days; although,
be it said to my still greater shame, it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
full a fortnight e'er I confessed my repentance
unto the wife whom I had so
abused.</p>

<p>But meseems I have in this digression
transgressed in the matter o' length; therefore,
to return to the bare facts.</p>

<p>It was on the subject of this ghost that
my lord and the Lady Margaret had disagreed.
My lord, being a flighty lad, although
a marvellous fine scholar and well-disposed,
did agree with my wife in the
matter of the ghost; while my lady was of
a like mind with myself.</p>

<p>It doth seem but yesterday that she came
to me as I was training the woodbine o'er
the arbor that led to her little garden, and
put her white hand on my shoulder. (My
lady was never one for wearing gloves, yet
the sun seemed no more to think o' scorching
her fair hands than the leaves of a day-lily.)
She comes to me and lays her hand
on my shoulder, and her long eyes they
laugh at me out of the shadow of her hat;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
but her mouth is grave as though I were a
corse.</p>

<p>Quoth she:</p>

<p>"Butter, dost thou believe in this ghost?"</p>

<p>"Nay, my lady," answered I, hoping to
shift her to better soil; "I ne'er meddle
with ghosts or goblins. Why, an there be
such things, should they wish me harm?
O' my word, my brain is no more troubled
with ghosts, black or white, than our gracious
Queen's"&mdash;here I doffed my cap&mdash;"is
with snails and slugs;" and here I
plucked a slug from a vine-leaf and set
my heel on't.</p>

<p>"Nay, nay!" quoth she, a-shutting of her
white eyelids so tight that all the long black
hairs on them stood straight out, like the
fringe on Marian's Sunday mantle in a
high wind. "Butter! thou nasty man!"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;for how dost thou mean, my
lady?" quoth I.</p>

<p>"Why, for mashing that poor beast to
a pap." And then a-holding of her hand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
level below her eyes, so that she might
not discern the ground, "Is he dead?"
quoth she.</p>

<p>"Dead?" asked I, for I was somewhat
puzzled in my mind.</p>

<p>"Ay, the slug; is he dead?"</p>

<p>"That he is, verily," said I; for in truth
he was naught but a jelly, and therewith I
drew a pebble over him with my foot, that
the sight o' his misfortune should not disturb
her tender heart.</p>

<p>"How if I were to crush you 'neath my
heel, Master Butter?" quoth she at last, having
peered about for the sight she dreaded,
and, not seeing it, returning to her discourse.
"How wouldst thou like that, excellent
Master Butter?" But somehow, as
I looked at her foot, my mouth, for all I
could do, went into a smile. For though
she was as fine a maiden as any in all
Warwickshire, her foot, methinks, was of
so dainty a make 'twould scarce have dealt
death to a rose.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>"But truly, my lady," continued I, seeing
that she was making up a face at me,
"thou knowest I've naught in common with
ghosts."</p>

<p>"Ay," quoth she. "And thou knowest
the like of me. But"&mdash;and here stops she,
with the slyest tip of her frowzed curls towards
the house&mdash;"thou knowest also this,
Butter, that his lordship, my brother, thinks
as doth Marian, thy wife, and that therein
we four cannot agree."</p>

<p>So I look at my hoe-handle, and say I,
"My lady, it is known to me."</p>

<p>"Well, now, Butter," she goes on, "thou
most wise, most excellent, most cunning,
most delectable of Butters, I have concocted
a plan. I' fecks, Butter" (for my
lady, like her Majesty the Queen, was somewhat
given to swearing, though more modest
oaths, as should become a subject)&mdash;"I'
fecks, Butter," saith she, "'tis a most
lustick plot. But I would not thy mome
heard us;" and with that she makes me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
send away Joe, the under-gardener. He
being gone, she whispers in my ear how
she hath plotted to fright his lordship and
Marian into very convulsions of further
conviction, by appearing to them at the
door o' the blue room in her night-gown,
with a taper in her hand and her face
chalked. What she desired o' me was,
that I should come to the blue room with
her, and there remain while she played off
this pretty fantasy on my lord and Marian.</p>

<p>To be truthful in these my last days o'
earth, I liked not my proffered office o'er-well.
Howbeit, that night did I do the bidding
o' my young mistress, and&mdash;loath am
I to speak of it, even at this late day&mdash;'twas
the cause of my young master's leaving
his home and going to bide in foreign
countries.</p>

<p>Ah, bitter tears did his sister weep, and
with mine own eyes I saw her, on the day
he set forth, cling to his neck, and when he
shook her thence, hang about his loins, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
when at last he pushed her to the ground,
she laid her hands about his feet and wept;
and between every sob it was, "Go not,
brother, for my fault! Go not, brother, for
my fault!" or else, "Robin, Robin, dost not
love me enough to forgive me so little?"
and then, "If thou didst but love me a little,
thou couldst forgive me much." But
he stepped free of her hands and went
his ways, and my lady lay with her head
where his feet had been, and was still.</p>

<p>Then Marian, who was very wroth with
me for my part in the matter, did up with
her nursling in her own proper strong arms
(for she was aye a strong lass, that being
one o' the chief reasons for which I had
sought her in marriage&mdash;having had, as
should all men, an eye to my posterity.
It was a great cross to me, as may be
thought, to find that all my forethought
had been in vain, and that while Turnip,
the farrier, had eight as fine lads as one
would care to father, of a puny wench<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
that my Marian could have slipped in her
pocket, Mistress Butter presented me with
no children, weakly or healthy). But, as
I have said, Marian, in her own arms, did
carry my lady up-stairs to her chamber,
and laid her on the day-bed.</p>

<p>And by-and-by she opes her eyes (for
Marian agreed that I sate on the threshold),
and says she, putting out her hand half-fearful-like,
"Is't thou, brother?"</p>

<p>"Nay, honey," saith Marian; "it is I,
thy Marian, thy nurse."</p>

<p>Then said my lady, "Ay, nurse; but my
brother, he is below&mdash;is't not so?" But
when Marian shook her head, my lady sate
up on the day-bed and caught hold of her
short curls, and cried out, "I have banished
him! I have made him an outlaw! I have
banished him!" And for days she lay like
one whose soul was sped.</p>

<p>Well, the young lord came not back, nor
would he write; so we knew not whether
he were alive or dead. Yet were Marian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and myself not unhopeful, for full oft did
the heady boy find some such cause of disagreement
with his sister to abide apart
from her. But when we saw that in truth
he came not back, and that week sped
after week, and month did follow month,
and still no tidings, we had perforce to acknowledge
that the young lord was indeed
gone to return no more.</p>

<p>The Lady Margaret, in her loneliness,
grew into many strange ways. She did
outride any man in the county, and she had
a blue-roan by the name of Robin Hood;
which same, methinks, no man in or out o'
th' county would 'a' cared to bestride. She
would walk over to Pebworth ('piping Pebworth,'
as Master Shakespeare hath dubbed
it) and back again, a distance o' some six
miles; and afterwards set forth for a gallop
on Robin Hood, and be no more a-weary,
come eventide, than myself from a trip
'round the gardens. She swam like a sea-maid,
she had fenced even better than her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
brother, and methinks she was the bonniest
shot with a long-bow of any woman in
all England. She was but fifteen when
my lord left Amhurste for aye, and in the
years since she had grown mightily, and
was waxed as strong as Marian, and full
a head taller. But she had long, curved
flanks that saved her from buxomness;
and her head was set high and light on
her shoulders, like a bird that floats on
a wave, and o'er it ran her bright curls,
the one o'er the other, like little wavelets.
Her eyes were as gray as a sword, and
as keen, and she had broad lids as white
as satin-flowers, and there was a fine
black ring around them, made by her
long lashes.</p>

<p>My lady was courted by many a fine
lord, and more than three youngsters have
I seen weep because of her coldness towards
them; speeding them away out o'
the sight o' mankind (as they thought), and
casting themselves along the lush grass in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
my lady's garden, there to bleat and bleat,
like moon-calves for the moon.</p>

<p>For one lad did my heart bleed, verily.
'Twas for the young Lord of Mallow&mdash;but
a lad with buttercup curls and speedwell
eyes, and a smile to win the love o' any
maid in her reason (though, to be sure, my
lady was in her reason). He comes to me
and gets between my knees, like any little
eanling that might 'a' been mine own, and
quoth he:</p>

<p>"Butter, Butter, she loves thee! Wilt
thou not speak to her, and tell her that she
shall be the richest lady in all England,
and maid of honor to the Queen, and have
more jewels than the Queen herself? Oh,
Butter!" cried he.</p>

<p>Then said I, a-stroking of the yellow
gossamer that bestrewed his shoulders, as
he knelt, head bowed, between my knees,
"Nay, my lord, 'tis not so that thou shalt
win the Lady Margaret. She careth no
more for jewels than she doth for the beads<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
in a rainbow; nor doth she care for riches.
And methinks a maid who would marry
just to be maid of honor to a queen would
not be an honorable maid either to herself
or to her sovereign;" for so indeed
I thought.</p>

<p>Then saith he, "Butter, dost thou believe
in love-philters?"</p>

<p>And I asked his meaning, for verily I
was ignorant of 't, albeit I was not ignorant
in all matters. And he explained to
me that it was a drink or potion to cause
love.</p>

<p>Then I answered, and said, "Calamint
doth make a good brew, likewise sage,
and some flax is soothing, but methinks
none o' these would cause love."</p>

<p>On this he wept again, but said that I
was a good old man, and that on his return
to Mallow he would send me a gift; and so
he did&mdash;a pair o' silk hose, such as my lady
and the Queen do wear; but being mindful
of my station, I laid them aside for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
sake o' th' poor lad, and yesterday Marian
did bring them to me, with her ten fingers
through as many moth-holes. Whereupon
I was minded o' th' text concerning that
we lay not up treasures where moth and
rust do corrupt, and at my behest Marian
read me the whole of that chapter. But
to return to bare facts.</p>

<p>It was on a certain night in March that
there occurred the conversation which was
the cause of this narrative. There had
been news of the return of one Lord Denbeigh
to Warwickshire&mdash;by report as wild a
cavalier as ever fought, and a godless body
to boot. Marian, who, as I have said, had
always a certain knack for ghost stories and
the like, froze me with her accounts o' this
wild lord's doings. Quoth she:</p>

<p>"Fire-brace is a suiting name for him,
inasmuch as 'tis a family name, and he a
fire-brand to peace wheresome'er he shall
go."</p>

<p>"Peace&mdash;peace thyself!" quoth I, hearing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
my lady's foot along the hall. And,
o' my word, Marian had but just ceased,
and given her attention to the fire, when
in clatters my lady, with her riding-whip
stuck in her glove, and her blood-hound
Hearn in a leash. She was much wrought,
either with riding or rage, for there was a
quick red in her cheek, and she had set
her red lips until they were white. Then
took she the hound between her knees, and
plucked off her gloves. Here I did find it
my duty to speak.</p>

<p>"My lady," cried I, "'tis not in your mind
to baste the dog?"</p>

<p>"Ay, that it is," quoth she, and her lips
went tighter, and she jerked at her glove.</p>

<p>Then said I, "How if he leap at thy
throat?" And she answered, "Nay, he
knows better;" and with that she gripped
his collar, and let swing her whip. Then
did I bid Marian that she leave the room.
As for me, it was my duty to stay, though,
as I have given an oath to tell but the truth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
in this narrative, I must confess that I was
in a sweat from head to foot with fear.</p>

<p>But the great hound crouched as though
he knew he got but what he deserved, and
when my lady had given him ten or twenty
lashes she flung wide the door, and said she,
"Get thee gone, coward! Go fare as fares
the poor beggar thou sought'st to bite!"
and the hound slunk out. Then turned my
mistress to me, and&mdash;"Butter," saith she,
"yon beast sought to bite an old beggar as
we came through the park, so I whipped
him. But for naught save cruelty or disobedience
will I ever whip a dog; so, Butter,
the next time that thou seest me about
to lash one, keep thy counsel." (This was
the harshest that my lady e'er spoke, either
to me or to Marian.) Then went she
to the door and called Marian.</p>

<p>"Come, nurse," quoth she, "I am a-weary.
Fling me some skins on the settle, and I
will lie down, and thou shalt card out my
locks with thy fingers." So we heaped the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
settle with the skins o' white bears, and
thereon my lady cast herself, like a flower
blown down upon a snow-bank; and by-and-by,
what with the warmth and Marian's
strokings, she fell into a deep sleep. But
we two sate and gazed on her.</p>

<p>She was all clad in a tight riding-dress
of green velour cloth, and her white face
seemed to come from the close collar like a
white lily from its sheath. She was e'er
flower-like, asleep or waking, as I have said,
and her pretty head was sleek and yellow,
like a butterfly's wing. She was so sound
that it appeared to me and Marian as
though one longer breath might transform
the mimicry into the actual thing&mdash;death.
But by-and-by awe fell from us, as it doth
ever fall, even in the presence of that which
hath awed us, and my wife and I did return
to our discourse concerning my Lord Denbeigh.</p>

<p>Quoth I to Marian, "But, wife, may not
malice invent these tales?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nay, nay," said she, shaking her head;
"as bloody a rogue as ever lived&mdash;as bloody
a rogue as ever lived. They do say as how
he'll set a whole tavern in a broil ere he be
entered in for three minutes."</p>

<p>"But," quoth I, "may he not be provoked?"</p>

<p>"Nay, I tell thee," said she; "but he'll
jump at a body's head, and cleave 't open
ere a body can say 'Jesus.'"</p>

<p>At this I said, firmly, "I doubt not but
what the poor man is most surely maligned."
Whereupon Mistress Butter did
wax exceeding wroth.</p>

<p>"Why wilt thou e'er be seeking to plead
the cause o' villains?" cried she. "First
that bloody beast o' my lady's, now this
bloody villain o' th' devil's. I do wonder at
thee, Anthony Butter." Whereat I did put
in that I sometimes wondered at myself.</p>

<p>"For why?" quoth she.</p>

<p>"Why, that I ever married to be worded
by a wench," said I. And at this I am<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
most entirely sure that she would have cast
her joint-stool at me, had she not been sitting
on 't, and my lady's head against her
knee. So she called me a "zany," and then
after a little a "toad," but went on stroking
my lady's hair.</p>

<p>And, by-and-by, back we come to his
lordship.</p>

<p>"'Tis not alone his bloody tricks and
murderous ways," quoth my wife, "that
causes all Christian folk to abhor him, but
he consorts with no other women than
drabs and callets. Dost excuse that?"</p>

<p>"Nay," said I, with sufficient gravity,
"then is this earl no longer a man, but
a swine, and not fit for men's discussion,
much less that of women."</p>

<p>At this reproof I saw anger again in
her eye, but she was so pleased withal at
having got me to call Lord Denbeigh a
swine that she forebore any further personal
affront.</p>

<p>"And yet," she went on, "they do say he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
be as fine a man as a wench will walk
through the rain to glimpse at, and a brave
and a learned; but that he wed a Spanish
maid, and she betrayed him, and so
he hath vowed to hate women, one and
all."</p>

<p>"Hast thou seen him?"</p>

<p>"Nay, but I've had him itemized to me
by the wife o' Humfrey Lemon. A blue
eye, a hooked nose, a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, well, wife," quoth I, "if a blue eye
and a hooked nose be as bad signs in a
man as they be in a horse, methinks this
thy villain is a very round villain."</p>

<p>"And so he is," affirmed she.</p>

<p>"Yet," said I, "there is somewhere in
me a something that doth pity him."</p>

<p>"By my troth!" cried my wife. "I do
believe, Master Butter, that thou'dst pity
the Devil's wife in childbirth."</p>

<p>"Ay, that I would!" I made answer, with
a great calmness, for I saw that she sought
to rouse my spleen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, do not bellow," blurted she, "for
my mistress is as sound as a gold-piece."</p>

<p>Then quoth my lady, a-rising up on her
elbow,</p>

<p>"Nay, that she is not. And, moreover,
she would hear all the stories concerning
this bad and bloody Lord of Denbeigh!"</p>


<h3><br />II.</h3>

<p>When Marian heard my lady so speak,
methought she would have swooned in verity;
for she knew my lady's contempt for
gossip. E'en for the first time in all her
life, Marian could not find a word to her
tongue.</p>

<p>"La! my lady," said she, and then stopped
and was silent. My lady laughed at
her, with her deep eyes; but as was her
wont, her mouth was wondrous solemn.</p>

<p>"Ay, nurse," quoth she, "thou thought'st
me safe i' th' Land o' Nod, but one hath<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
ears to hear there as elsewhere." Then
she reaches out one hand and plays with
Marian's ruff. "Go to, nurse," says she.
"Dost thou not see I am even i' th' same
case with thyself? I too would gossip a little.
Come, word it&mdash;word it!"</p>

<p>So Marian told her all that she had
heard, together with a little prophesying
here and there, which boded no good to
my Lord Denbeigh. She told how he
had e'en been a brave lad, but how in
Spain he had wed with a wife who played
him false; how then he had vowed vengeance
on all womankind, becoming a brawler
and a haunter o' taverns; how death
was in his sword and lightnings in his eye.</p>

<p>My lady listened, and now and again she
would pinch her eyelids softly with her
thumb and ring-finger, as one who is deep
in thought. But when Marian paused for
breath, she turned to her, and quoth she,</p>

<p>"Nurse, thou hast often preached unto
me; listen now to my preachings. Thou<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
shalt often hear a man abused, nurse, but
chiefly for that which he hath never done.
This wild lord, I doubt not, hath been guilty
of sorry deeds. What man hath not?
But the half that thou hast told me is not
to be believed."</p>

<p>Then went she to her room, taking Marian
with her, but I saw that she was
moved.</p>

<p>It was but the next day that my lady's
uncle, Sir John Trenyon, came riding into
the court. He often came in such wise, to
bide for a day or two with his niece. A
most courteous gentleman; red of face,
blue of eye, and blithe of tongue. He
had a jest for each tick o' th' clock, and
a kind word for all.</p>

<p>"Ah, Butter," saith he, "and where is thy
mistress? And thy wife, the good Dame
Marian&mdash;where is she? And how about
thy family? Hast thou no better prospects
than of yore?"</p>

<p>Whereat I looked sorrowful enough, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
doubt not, for he did bid me take heart, as
my first-born might have had a hare-lip or
a crook-back. Then did he toss me his
bridle-reins, and my lady, having heard his
voice, came forth to meet him.</p>

<p>"So, lady-bird!" quoth he, clasping her.
"I am come for no less than three reasons
this time. First, to see thy bonny
face. Second, to ride thy bonny Robin.
Third, to inquire and seek out a certain
villain of mine acquaintance, of whom you
have doubtless heard;" and forthwith did
he say to her of how the wicked Lord
Denbeigh was the son of a friend and
comrade, and of how he had known him
when a lad, together with much more, at
which my lady pricked up her ears, as
'twere, having all a lady's love for stories
of wicked men who are not yet either old
or ill-favored.</p>

<p>"By my troth," declared the old knight
in ending, "I will take but a mouthful to
stay me, and then set forth straightway in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
quest o' th' rascal." So having dined right
heartily, he rode forth again.</p>

<p>Now, having related this hap to Marian,
she was devoured of so great a curiosity
that, as I am an honest man, I looked to
see her consumed even unto her bones, as
some men who burn of drink. She would
have it that I must hazard a guess on the
shape of Lord Denbeigh's nose, the color
of his hair, and the height of his body.
She forced me to wonder whether he were
civil or rude of tongue. She pressed me
to say whether I thought there was aye
a chance of his returning with Sir John.
She questioned me, in a word, until, having
no answers, I was like to lose my wits,
or my temper, or both together. At last
comes she and sits on my knee, and tickles
the back of my neck right playfully, as in
the days of our wooing.</p>

<p>"As I live, Tony," quoth she, "we are
like to have a strange story under our
very noses. What if"&mdash;and here she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
takes my face in her two hands, and sets
her chin against mine, so that I see four
round blue eyes against her white brow,
and am like to go blind with her thoughtlessness&mdash;"what
if it turns out that the
Lord hath set upon our lady to be the
saviour of this wicked earl?"</p>

<p>"Ay," cried I. "And what if the Lord
hath set upon me to be the founder of
a nation, like Abraham? What then?"
At which she boxed my ears right soundly.
But I could not blame her, for in
the wrong I was, without doubt, although
verily she had plagued me into it. So
I sued for pardon, and got it, and a
kiss into the bargain. But she would
not leave me in peace concerning Lord
Denbeigh.</p>

<p>When that same afternoon there comes
Sir John a-riding past, and the bad earl at
his side, "What dost thou say now?" quoth
Marian, a-plucking me in a way that did
not serve to increase good feeling betwixt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
us. "Ah ha! Are not women prophetesses
by nature?"</p>

<p>"Ay, by ill-nature," answered I; and for
this quip I was not forgiven for two days.</p>

<p>It was towards the setting of the sun
when Sir John and Lord Denbeigh rode
up to the door of Amhurste, and my lady,
knowing naught, came out at the sound of
the horses' feet, thinking only to greet her
uncle. The red light from the west shone
on her, and dabbled her white kirtle as
with blood, and her face was like one of
the red roses in her garden. So she put
up her hand to shield it, and saw the
stranger standing at her feet.</p>

<p>There was ne'er a nobler-looking man,
for all he might outblack Satan in his
soul: straight of body, and strong of limb,
and lofty of head. His hair was the color
of my lady's, and there seemed to be
ever some sunshine in it, as he moved
his head. Methought his face was fair
and goodly to look upon, albeit his lips<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
went downward at the corners, and there
was a droop in his broad lids. He was
clad all in a close suit of dark velvet, and
in his hand he held a black hat with a knot
of heron-plumes.</p>

<p>My lady stood and looked down at him
from under her long, white hand, and he
stood and looked up at my lady, as one
looks upward at a fair picture. And the
evening light crept between them. I was
ashamed of my own folly, when I did catch
myself remembering Marian's silly sayings;
but for all that, they did come back to me,
as the words of a foolish woman will return
to the wisest of men. And in truth he did
gaze up at her, as though she were more
holy than the heavens above her. And
for all her hand, the sunset found its way
unto her cheek.</p>

<p>What I now relate was told me by
Marian some three days after. 'Twas on
the night of the day on which Sir John
had brought the stranger to Amhurste,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and Marian was carding out my lady's
tresses before her bedroom fire.</p>

<p>Quoth my lady, suddenly, "Nurse, didst
thou see Lord Denbeigh ere he went?"</p>

<p>And Marian said that she had seen him.</p>

<p>"He hath a strange face, nurse."</p>

<p>"How 'strange,' my lady?"</p>

<p>"Why, it seems to me that each feature
in it doth contradict the other. His brow
is stern, and saith to his eyes, 'Ye shall
not be gentle.' His eyes say to his nose,
'Spread not thy nostrils so proudly.' His
nose commands his lips that they smile
not; but, nurse, there was ne'er a sweeter
smile on the lips o' a saint!"</p>

<p>Marian fell a-thinking, and pulled my
lady's hair. My lady heeded it not, so
Marian fell a-thinking yet more deeply.</p>

<p>"It is not a face that tells of a bad
heart," continued my lady. "Rather it
speaks of rebellion and misfortune. A
sad story&mdash;a sad story."</p>

<p>"What is, my lady?" asked Marian; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
my lady was far away, whither Marian
could not follow.</p>

<p>"Nurse," she saith, presently, "that were
a soul worth saving." Then got she suddenly
to her feet, and turned and took her
nurse's hands with hers. "It shall be saved,"
she saith, "God helping."</p>

<p>And she kissed Marian, and lay down
upon her bed. But Marian did tell me how
that no sleep visited her lady's eyes that
night. Through the darkness she could
hear her turn, first on this side, then on
that; then sigh and move her pillow, and
sigh again.</p>

<p>Methought Marian would have split in
sunder with importance, when Lord Denbeigh
took to coming sometimes to Amhurste.
'Twas never for even an hour
that he stayed; and 'twas always some
question of business that brought him.
But my lady and he touched hands full
oft during a week, and always he would
look at her with a different look from that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
which his eyes did wear at other times.
And she spoke to him e'er courteously
and kindly, even as though he had been
a holy man and worthy of all reverence.</p>

<p>One day it chanced that my lady rode
the blue-roan out into the woods, towards
the hut of old Joan Gobble, who was crippled
by reason of age. My lady had me
follow her on Dumble, th' white nag, with
a pat o' butter and some wine. I was taken
up with pondering as to why my lady should
go in person to Dame Gobble's, seeing she
might have sent me alone on Dumble as
well. Be that as it may, as we rode along
by a brook-side, under the thick leaves, whom
should we come upon but my Lord Denbeigh.
He was kneeling beside the water,
and holding down his hand into the brook.
As I looked I saw that his hand was befouled
with gore, and that the brown stream
did rush away ruddily from beneath his fingers.</p>

<p>My lady did not wait for me to hold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Robin Hood, but did swing herself from
her saddle, and was beside the earl in a
trice. He looked up, and seeing her, did
start upon his feet.</p>

<p>"Nay," said she, putting out her hand,
"but tell me if I can aid thee."</p>

<p>And he strove to hide his hand at his
side, saying. "Tis but a scratch;" but
the blood ran down like water on the
grass.</p>

<p>"Think not to spare me the sight o'
blood," said my lady, "for I am learned in
bandaging wounds." And certes she was,
seeing that every soul at Amhurste did
come to her for healing, let a cat but
scratch them. And she took his hand between
her two fair hands (having drawn off
her gloves), and saw that his wrist was deeply
severed as with a knife. But she asked
him no questions, telling him only to stoop
while she cleansed his hand sufficiently to
bind it. And as she laid it in the water,
and pressed the lips of the wound together,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
he said unto her in a low tone, not meaning
that I should hear him,</p>

<p>"Would that thou couldst wash my soul
as thou hast washed my hand!"</p>

<p>She looked straight into his eyes, with
her own so clear and honest, like a dog's
(meaning no disrespect to my lady, as God
knows), and she answered him and saith,</p>

<p>"It were well worth the washing, my lord;
but an higher than I must cleanse it."</p>

<p>And he saith, "There is none higher."</p>

<p>At that my lady's blood rose in her
cheek, but she besought him that he would
not speak to her in such wise. When
she had made a compress of the napkins
in the basket wherein I was carrying
Dame Gobble's butter, and had stanched
the blood, she unwound the ribbon
from her silver hunting-horn, and cast it
about his neck for a rest to his wounded
arm. Then he did bend down his
head and kissed the ribbon, and my lady
turned quickly, and got upon the roan,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
and rode away at so smart a pace that
methinks Dame Gobble's butter and wine
did reach her in a closer conjunction than
she could have found pleasant.</p>

<p>When I told Marian of this encounter,
merely by the way of a bit of gossip, she
did smile in such a wise that I was minded
to cuff a woman for the first time in
a long life.</p>

<p>It was that same night that Marian did
tell me how that she feared the earl was
in danger of some sort, judging by certain
words that my lady had let fall in her
sleep. I noticed how that my lady seemed
restless, and would start at the clap o'
a door, or when Herne did come suddenly
upon her. And one day she leaned from
a window, as I swept up the rose-leaves
from the grass on the east terrace, and
called to me to come thither. She was as
white as her kirtle, and her gray eyes were
dark like water before a storm. She did
not look at me, but beyond into the air.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
So I waited, having plucked off my cap,
and my lady stood looking, looking; and
after a while she saith,</p>

<p>"Thou hast aye been a true and faithful
servant unto me: therefore I am about to
give unto thee a great charge."</p>

<p>And I said, "My lady, thou knowest that
thou canst trust me;" and in truth I could
say no more, for my throat was stiff.</p>

<p>And she continued and said,</p>

<p>"Thou must be to-night at the Red
Deer, and that by nine of the clock. One
will be there in whom we have both deep
interest. I cannot tell thee more. Take
thy sword with thee, but have no fear&mdash;thou
wilt have no cause to use it. Yet,
lest thou be fearful, take it with thee."
And she said, "Thou wilt remember?"</p>

<p>"My lady, when have I e'er forgotten
word of thine?" Whereat she did put
out her fair hand to me, saying, "Never,"
and there were tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>So that night (for the first time in many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
years) did I find myself within the doors
of the Red Deer. A cosey place it was,
despite the wine-bibbers that did profane it;
and the inn-keeper's wife, a most buxom,
eye-pleasing wench, with three sturdy boys
aye clambering about her. As I looked,
some hard and sinful thoughts did visit
my heart concerning the bounty that the
Lord had lavished upon one who was a
barterer of wine, when I, who had lived
ever a temperate and (in so far as was in
my power) a godly life, should remain childless.
But I did conquer at last, bidding
Satan get behind me, and was left in peace
to toast my feet, and to ponder as to who
it was that my lady had sent me thither to
mark. Had I not loved my lady with all
my heart, methinks I could not have stood
the terms that were heaped upon me by
the brawlers. I will not repeat the foul
slanders; suffice it to say, I sustained for
one half hour what few men are called
upon to endure throughout a lifetime.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>At last, the newness being gone, they left
me in peace, and I, being settled safely in
my corner, did set to work to watch the
door.</p>

<p>Who should enter at that very moment
but my Lord Denbeigh! He was wrapped
in a long brown cloak, and wore a broad
hat, unornamented by plume or buckle,
pulled down over his eyes. He came and
tossed himself into a chair near the fire,
and sat there pondering upon the coals,
with his legs out in front of him. Now,
I have ever had a woman-weakness for
a goodly leg in man, and the splendid
limbs of Lord Denbeigh did witch me into
a steadier gaze than that which civility
doth permit. This by-and-by he did notice,
and so spoke to me.</p>

<p>"At what art thou staring, ancient?"
quoth he, not unkindly. So I told him,
whereupon he laughed somewhat.</p>

<p>"Methinks thou art but a doting body,"
he said, "and yet is thy face familiar.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
What now? Hast thou e'er met with me
before?"</p>

<p>Then did I lie right roundly, being, to
confess the truth, not a little afraid.</p>

<p>"Out on thee," saith his lordship; "the
truth is not in thee. I ne'er forget a face;
how, then, shall I forget a face such as
thine? Certes I have seen thee before.
Wilt thou colt me?"</p>

<p>And again lied I&mdash;blackly, most abominably.</p>

<p>"As thou wilt," quoth he; "but thy face
is known to me, for all that."</p>

<p>It was at this time that the door opened
again, and there did enter a stripling, clad
all in dark maroon velvet, wrapped also
about with a long cloak, and having a velvet
bonnet pulled down over his brows i' th'
manner o' Lord Denbeigh's. One could see
naught o' his visage for the shadow from
his head-gear. The revelers scarce noted
his entrance, being far gone in drink, and
some having departed, and others asleep.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
The lad came and stood near the fire, and
I saw that he looked at Lord Denbeigh
from under his drooping bonnet&mdash;the earl
having withdrawn unto a table apart, with
a glass of wine and some papers, and his
sword across the table. Even as I looked
the boy turned, and went over, and leaned
on the table to finger the heavy sword. My
heart was afraid within me, for there was a
dark light in the eyes that flashed up at the
youth from under Lord Denbeigh's stern
brows. I was nigh unto them, being but a
stride or two apart, and so marked all that
passed between them.</p>

<p>"By my troth," quoth his lordship, "a valiant
crack!"</p>

<p>"Meaning me?" quoth the lad, smiling.</p>

<p>"Ay, meaning thee, Sir Insolence. Dost
thou know how to handle thine own sword,
that thou handlest a stranger's so freely?"</p>

<p>"Even so. But I meant not to vex thee.
In truth, I am come to thee on an errand
of life and death;" and as he spoke, he did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
doff his bonnet and toss it upon the table,
and the firelight and candlelight did leap
upon his fair curls, and as I saw his face it
was the face of my lady. The earl did start
half-way to his feet, and his face was first
like fire and then like snow.</p>

<p>"Margaret!" he saith, back of his teeth,
as 'twere.</p>

<p>And the lad smiled, leaning still upon
the table.</p>

<p>"Nay; my sister is called so," he said,
"but my name is Robert, and I am the
Lord of Amhurste and her brother. Haply
she hath mentioned me unto your lordship."</p>

<p>The earl stared as one who sees a ghost
(though I believe not in them myself), and
he saith, "Whence comest thou? All think
that thou art dead."</p>

<p>And the boy said,</p>

<p>"Nay, but I would not that any besides
thee knew of my whereabouts. As to thee,
I know more concerning thee even than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
my sister, and it is for her sake that I
come to thee to-night."</p>

<p>And my lord saith, "For her sake?"</p>

<p>"Even so. I am come to persuade
thee that thou wilt not go on the errand
thou wottest of two nights hence. There
are those who do mean thee death. It
is certain that thy life is plotted against.
Surely thou wilt be warned?" And as I
looked, the color left the lad's face, and he
grew white as any woman. Almost I could
have sworn it was my lady's face. Line
for line, eyelash for eyelash, look for look.
And methought no mother's heart e'er
yearned towards her new-born babe as
yearned my heart towards the youth. It
seemed as though I must cry out to
him. To see him thus after five weary
years; to be so near him, and yet unable
to touch even the latchet of his
shoes, or to hear his voice calling my
name. I trembled and was blind with
longing. When at last I did look up,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
he said again, "Surely, thou wilt be advised?"</p>

<p>The earl leaned with his forehead set in
his clasped hands, and by-and-by he said,</p>

<p>"It is impossible. Would that I could!"</p>

<p>And the lad said,</p>

<p>"Nay, it is not impossible. Thou canst
save thine own life with a word."</p>

<p>And Lord Denbeigh answered him:</p>

<p>"My life is not worth even a word," and
he did not lift up his forehead from his
hands.</p>

<p>Then said my master, "Thy life may be
worth less than naught to thee, but to others
its price is above their own." And
again he was as pale as any girl.</p>

<p>And he spoke again and said, "Thou
wilt not go? Thou wilt be warned?"</p>

<p>And again did the man answer, saying,
"Impossible."</p>

<p>Then saith my master,</p>

<p>"Lord Denbeigh, if thou goest to London
on the morrow, I will follow thee there.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Nay, thou canst not prevent me. And
think you my sister's heart will be warmer
towards thee if her brother's blood be
spilled at thy behest?"</p>

<p>And the earl sat with his stern eyes on
the lad, and he said,</p>

<p>"Thy blood will ne'er be spent at my behest.
I do forbid thee to follow me."</p>

<p>And the lad said,</p>

<p>"I am not to be forbidden." So they
stood and looked at one another. And all
at once the boy put out his hand ('twas
my lady's very gesture) and took the earl's
sleeve, and saith he in a gentle voice,</p>

<p>"Thou wert a man after God's own heart
did not thou let Satan consort with thee."</p>

<p>Then turned Lord Denbeigh with a
laugh that was not merry. And he saith,</p>

<p>"As thou quotest Scripture to me, select
thy texts with greater care. Even to my
mind there doth come one more suiting;
for even as Job, 'I am a brother to dragons,
and a companion to owls.'"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Then saith the lad, still with his hand
on the man's arm,</p>

<p>"Is it not the more to thy discredit that
thou, who couldst be brother to Christ, do
make brothers of dragons? Verily, my
lord, I am bold through my sister, for methinks
it is thus that she would have answered
thee."</p>

<p>And the man turned away as though to
hide his face.</p>


<h3><br />III.</h3>

<p>Lord Robert spoke with Lord Denbeigh
at some length, but he was not to be
turned from his purpose (which, methought,
must be a very strange and grewsome one,
judging by their words). So finally they
went out separately, and I got me back to
Amhurste.</p>

<p>The next morning I did relate to my
lady all that had passed, but mentioning no
names, as I saw that she wished it not.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
And when I was finished she bade me go
straightway to London and find out the
whereabouts of Lord Denbeigh. Moreover,
she told me that she herself would be
there shortly with Marian, and that they
two would lodge at the house of Marian's
aunt, one Mistress Pepper, a linen-draper's
wife. At this I wondered greatly, the more
that she should keep silent concerning her
brother than that she should follow him to
London. And all that I could think was
that Lord Robert was in some dire conspiracy,
likewise the earl, and that she feared
for the lives of one or both. So we all
go to London, I earlier than my lady and
Marian.</p>

<p>For a day I lost sight of Lord Denbeigh
(whom I had followed closely all the way
from Warwickshire), but the next afternoon
I marked him as he passed along a by-way,
and heard him speak with some one of his
friends, naming a tavern where he would
meet him at a certain hour that night.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>So first I found out where the tavern
was, then straight to my lady and acquainted
her with all that I had discovered.</p>

<p>She said naught but to commend my
diligence, and she went whiter than a just
washed sheep at shearing-time. Quoth I
to myself, "Butter, there is more here than
thou wottest of;" which was very true.</p>

<p>That night, a little before the hour set
upon, I did get me to the tavern, and
lurked quietly in the shadows where none
might observe; and there, verily, was the
earl and him with whom he had spoken in
the afternoon. He had but said a word or
so when Lord Robert entered, and went
and stood at his elbow, but did not touch
him or pluck at his cloak. Albeit, the earl
seemed to feel his presence, for shortly he
turned and saw the lad.</p>

<p>"How!" quoth he. "Thou here?"</p>

<p>And the boy said, "I told thee I would
follow thee."</p>

<p>And Lord Denbeigh answered him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
"Dost thou know of what thou speakest?"</p>

<p>And the lad said, "Verily I know, and
thou mayest trust me;" and with that he
muttered two or three words under his
breath, which, because of mine old ears, I
could not catch. And the two men started
and looked at one another. Then the earl
did turn to his friend, saying to him that
they could indeed trust the lad. So they
three clasped hands. When that was done,
Lord Denbeigh turns to my master, and
saith he, "Hast thou thy dirk with thee?"
and the lad answered that he had both
sword and dagger.</p>

<p>"Not that there is any danger," quoth
the earl, "but that thou mayest feel easy."</p>

<p>But the lad said, "There is danger, as I
have told thee; and thou art putting thy
life in jeopardy." At this Lord Denbeigh
only laughed; but as they went out into the
street I marked that he kept the lad close at
his side, almost as a mother keeps a child.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>The night was still and cold, and the
sky full of little white clouds that lapped
the one over the other, like shells on a seashore.
Now and again the moon would
strike through, in a long, bright ray, that
seemed like a keen blade or lance severing
the misty air. The three went on and on,
through many winding ways, and still I followed,
for I knew not into what danger the
lad might be hastening.</p>

<p>All at once, in a dark turning, there
came the clang of swords and a rushing
and scuffling, but no cry of any kind;
and methought the silence was more hideous
than sound. Stiff as were my old
joints with disuse, I drew my sword and
lay about me lustily, striving to get between
the villains and my young master
(which is no credit to me, as I was so
wrought with rage that I verily believe I
would have no more felt the thrust of a
rapier than Marian's housewife the prick
of a needle). But there was no method in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
aught, neither could anything be seen; for
the moon had withdrawn behind the clouds,
and we seemed to be fighting underneath
clear water, so pale and ghastly was the
light shed about us from the pale clouds.
And as I struck out with my sword I saw
a fellow in a mask close with Lord Denbeigh,
lifting a dagger high in his hand,
while another rascal pinned the earl's hands
to his sides. And even as I looked, the lad
leaped between, and the thin knife went
deep into his breast. At the same time
there was a louder clash of swords, and
a thudding of men's bodies together, and
the masked wretches turned about and did
take to their heels with a good will. So
I sheathed my sword and ran forward.</p>

<p>Lord Denbeigh and his friend were bending
over the lad, who lay out-stretched between
them, with his white face turned up
to the white sky, looking like the face of
a dead man at the bottom of a clear pool.
Then could I not withhold my grief, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
cried aloud, "My master, my master!" and
tried to feel with my trembling old hands
for the wound.</p>

<p>Then said the earl, "Not here! I will
carry him to a place of safety." And he
lifted the boy in his arms, as though he
had been a hurt child.</p>

<p>When the other saw that, he laid hold
on Lord Denbeigh's arm, saying, "What
mean you? are you distraught? There is
but scarce time by the clock."</p>

<p>And the earl said, "Go you on. I must
take this boy where his wound can be
bound."</p>

<p>"Nay," said the man. "I tell you, you
are mad!"</p>

<p>And Lord Denbeigh turned on him, and
spoke in a harsh voice:</p>

<p>"I have said I will not go. I have done
with thee and thine. Go thy ways ere it
be too late;" and he passed on and left the
man to swallow the moonshine with his
great gaping mouth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>And he saith unto me, "Follow closely."
So by-and-by we came to a great gray
house, and Lord Denbeigh opened the door
and bade me enter with him.</p>

<p>We passed through a vast hall, and up a
ponderous staircase, and into a room. A
fire was burning on the hearth, and there
was a fantastic kind of lamp swinging from
a silver chain above the bed's foot.</p>

<p>I guessed rightly that this was his lordship's
own apartment. He laid the lad on
the bed, and fell to undoing his doublet of
black velvet. I did see him set to shivering,
as 'twere, when he noted the red stains
on the shirt underneath, and my heart
stood still within me. Then he opened
the red linen, and did put in his hand gently
to feel if the heart were yet beating;
but no sooner had he done this than he
gave a strange cry, and drew out his hand
dripping with blood, and stood staring and
trembling. At the same moment the lad
stirred, and opened his eyes, and began to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
clutch feebly at his doublet, drawing it together.
I made naught of it until Lord
Denbeigh did turn to me, with the face of
a dead man, and quoth he, "Stay here while
I fetch women," and so rushed out like one
in truth distraught.</p>

<p>Then did it all come upon me, and I
knew that the face upon which I looked
was the face of my lady.</p>

<p>Ere another second had passed I heard
the earl's voice without, and he spoke with
a woman:</p>

<p>"Do thou go instantly and clothe the
lady within in some of thy garments; and
have care that thou say no word to any of
what hath happened, else will it not be
well for thee."</p>

<p>When I heard the tone in which he
spoke, methought in truth it would not be
well for her did she not heed his commands.</p>

<p>Shortly there entered a woman most
marvellous fair, with hair that seemed spun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
of black taffetas, and a skin like a white
jasmine. When she saw the blood her lips
whitened, and she did close them more
closely, but no cry escaped her. Whereat
I was much ashamed, remembering the
hullabaloo that I had raised.</p>

<p>I turned aside while she disrobed my
lady and clothed her in clean linen, and
drew down the sheets, placing her between
them. But the blood still flowed in spite
of all bandages, and the fair linen was soon
crimson.</p>

<p>And when all was prepared, the woman
went to the door and said, "You can enter,"
and the earl came into the chamber again.
When, however, he did see my lady he
cried out, "God in heaven! she will bleed
to death!" and he called the woman, and
showed her how to stanch the wound.
Then, when the steps of the surgeon were
heard in the hall without, he said unto
her, "Remember. She is thy sister, and
thieves have stabbed her for the jewels<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
on her neck." And she answered him, "I
will remember."</p>

<p>And all this time methought I was in
an evil dream, and that Marian, for some
spite, would not awaken me.</p>

<p>How it came about, to this day I recollect
not, but ere two weeks had sped we
were again at Amhurste, and my lady in
her own bower, under Marian's care. As
to that, Marian had been with my lady
ever since the fatal night whereon she was
nigh done to death by that masked ruffian.</p>

<p>The earl did go himself to fetch her
from Mistress Pepper's, and after that she
came neither of us saw the sloe-eyed
woman any more.</p>

<p>None had known of my lady's stay in
town, saving my lady herself, Lord Denbeigh,
the black-eyed woman (who never
uttered word more, good or bad, after that
she had said, "I will remember"), Marian,
and me. So besides us five no one was
the wiser.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>It was towards the last of May that my
lady did beg that we would lift her out to
sit in a long-chair on the east terrace.
The birds were at their morning gossiping
in the shrubbery, and the air was most
sweet with the breath of the white lilacs.
My lady looked like a snow-wreath fallen
suddenly among the greenery of spring,
but her eyes did peep softly, like bluebells,
from the snows of her face. Methought
she was all white and blue, like the
heavens above her, and her hair made sunshine
over all. Herne, the blood-hound,
lay at her feet, and would not be stirred,
though for sport my lady had Marian to
tempt him with some comfits.</p>

<p>While we were all there, and my lady
showing us how the light shined through
her thin hands, and discoursing right merrily,
there came a page and handed her a
letter. Back fell she among her pillows,
and her eyelids dropped over her eyes,
like snow-flakes fallen on violets. Anon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
she opened the letter, and having read it,
said unto Marian, "Nurse, go bid him
hither." So Marian beckoned me, and we
left her. As we entered the house, who
should pass us but my Lord of Denbeigh,
and o' my word he was whiter than my
lady, if anything, and wrapped as usual in
a long cloak. He seemed not to see us,
and we went on in silence.</p>

<p>Here transpires the only part of this
narrative concerning which I am reluctant
to write. I will out with it, however,
and the Almighty knows that I have not
done with repentance even yet. So be it.
There was a window overhanging the terrace
where my lady sat (the window out
of which she had leaned to speak to me
about repairing to the Red Deer). But
let me not defer longer. I, Anthony Butter,
of respectable parents, and counted
among my fellows and betters an honest
man, did go to this window, and did most
deliberately listen to the words that passed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
between my mistress and the Earl of Denbeigh.
In fact (for I have sworn to keep
back no jot or tittle of the truth), I did
speed me so fast that I was at the window
ere his lordship reached my lady's side.</p>

<p>He came slowly, but his look went before
him, and was fast upon my lady's face
ere he himself was within ten yards of her.
When at last he was come to her side,
he did stand and look down on her, but
uttered no word. And also my lady did
look down, and there was a light like sunset
on her cheek.</p>

<p>Then suddenly did he drop upon his
knees beside her, and bowed down his
head upon her knee and was silent. Then
my lady (God forever keep her!) did turn
her eyes quickly, and stole a look to see
that no one was nigh (God forgive my
dastardly presence!), and did reach out
one pale hand, half fearfully as 'twere, and
did let it rest upon the man's bowed head,
as a white rose-leaf falls and rests on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
earth. And she said but two words, "My
friend;" yet methought all love was in
them. Whereat he raised his head and
looked at her, and it is so that men look
upward when they pray. He took her
hands with his and held them to his breast,
and he saith, "Dear saint, if thou forgivest
me, wilt thou but kiss my brow?" And
she bended forward and kissed him; and
he trembled, calling her by name; and she
asked him what he would with her. Then
kneeling at her side, he spoke to her, and
his words were as follows:</p>

<p>"Thou hast heard of my life and of my
misfortunes, but all hath not been told
thee. Grant me but patience for a moment,
that I myself may tell thee all."</p>

<p>And she saith unto him, "Say on."</p>

<p>So he spoke and said, "There is much
that I may not tell thee, yet part I will tell
thee, for that I must. Thou hast heard
how that my wife&mdash;" But he could not
continue, so dropped his face into my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
lady's hands, and she waited for him, saying
softly,</p>

<p>"I will understand what thou dost not
say. Be not troubled, but speak out thy
soul to me;" and presently he told her
more. As I do live, never listened I to
sadder story. So piteous it was that my
tears fell down like rain, and I was sore
afraid that my sighing would discover my
whereabouts. But the Almighty is merciful
even to sinners, and I remained unnoted.
'Twas the old tale of love and
treachery; a false wife and a friend who
was a villain.</p>

<p>The earl had killed the man (but in fair
encounter), and his wife he had brought
back, never to be as husband to her more,
but to preserve her from further sin. And
I do maintain that 'twas a noble act, and
I did quite forgive him the blood of his
betrayer. Methought my lady did forgive
him too, for she did but stroke his hair
softly, saying ever and anon, "Poor soul!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
or "God help thee!" And by-and-by he
lifted his face, and saith, "But the worst is
yet to tell thee."</p>

<p>And she said again, "Say on."</p>

<p>And he trembled again, but spoke out
bravely: "My wife yet lives. It was she
who bound thy wounds."</p>

<p>Now at this I thought to see my lady
swoon; but she only smiled, though better
had one seen her weep than smile in
such wise. And she saith, "I have known
that these many days;" and she leaned towards
him, and placed both hands upon his
head, saying, "Weep not. I hold thee
guiltless. Do not weep."</p>

<p>But he sobbed, clasping her knees, as
one whose heart is broken, saying now
and again below his breath, "O God! O
God!"</p>

<p>If there be this side the stars a more
awful sight than the sight of a strong man
in tears, God grant I may ne'er behold it,
for surely I should die of pity. Doth it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
please God that I resemble Abraham in
the matter of age, if in none other, ne'er
will that scene fade from my memory&mdash;my
lady, so wan and white and narrow, like a
tall lily over which a rude wind hath swept,
and at her knee the strong man, bowed as
a little lad that saith his prayers, clasping
her kirtle and her hands, as though one
sinking in deep waters were to grasp at a
floating stem of flowers for support. And
after a while, when the violence of his grief
was spent, he saith unto her,</p>

<p>"I sail for Spain with Essex on the morrow,
as thou knowest; but it doth remain
for me to tell thee why I go. It is for that
I think the lad, thy brother, hath been a
prisoner of war these many years, and I go
to bring him to thee."</p>

<p>And she sat and looked at him as
though her heart had leaped from her
breast into his body; but she spake no
words save only, "God keep thee; God go
with thee."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>And suddenly he saith unto her, as
though the words would forth,</p>

<p>"I loved thee from the moment that I
saw thee. Let me but tell thee that."</p>

<p>She whispered, saying, "It was even so
with me." And he lifted his eyes and
looked at her. Then fled I, as though I
had drawn away the veil from the sanctuary,
for I thought that God would surely
smite me for having beheld that look.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>So Lord Denbeigh sailed with the Earl
of Essex for the war in Spain, and my
lady's soul left her body and went with
him; for surely 'twas but her body that
remained at Amhurste. All day long
would she sit silent, nor move, nor look,
and her hands the one upon the other before
her, as who should say, "I am done
with all things, whether of work or of
play." So passed the months, and ever
and anon some report would reach the village
of the wild earl's deeds in Spain, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
of how he would fight ten men with one
arm wounded and the blood in his eyes,
and such like tales. But no word came
direct, either through letters or friends.
So passed the months, and it was nigh to
August, and the fighting was over for the
time, when one day, with a clattering as
of a horsed army, there comes dashing into
the court two cavaliers on horseback, and
one of them was my Lord of Denbeigh.
Ere I could look at the other he had leaped
to the ground, and had me about the
neck a-kissing me as roundly as ever a
wench in the market-place. And lo! when
I looked, it was Lord Robert in very truth.
He was grown out of all knowledge, and
as brown as a nut, but as big and as bonny
a lad as ever clapped hand to sword.</p>

<p>When I could turn my eyes from him
upon the earl, I saw that he was waxed
as pale as death, and wore his arm in a
kerchief, and that there was a great red
streak adown his temple, clean through his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
right eyebrow. And his splendid flanks
and chest were hollow, like those of a good
steed that lacketh fodder. But when he
stood and leaned against his horse's neck
and smiled at us, methought he was by far
the goodliest man that ever I had looked
upon. His teeth were as white as the foam
on his horse's bit, and there was a deep nick
at the corner of his mouth, like that at the
mouth of a girl.</p>

<p>Then must I call Marian, and send her
to break the news to my lady. So in a
moment she comes rushing down along the
stair-way, like a branch that is blown suddenly
from the top o' a tall tree, and so
into Lord Robert's arms; and he catches
her to his heart, and so stands holding
her; and they make no motion nor
any sound whatever. Then turns the earl
away, and leaves them together. But I
marked that his eyes were brimming, and
that there was a quiver in his lip.</p>

<p>Ere night all is known to us: how Lord<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Robert had been a prisoner in Spain all
these years, yet was he treated with courtesy
at the behest o' some wench. But he
did not love her, God be praised! And
'tis in my mind to this day how he might
have wed her, and how the earl did relate
to him his bitter experiences with a Spanish
wife. Ay, that is my firm opinion. All
this and more did we hear, laughing and
weeping by turns. But it was not until
Lord Robert saw my lady alone that she
heard of how the earl had saved him at
the risk of his own life, all but bearing him
in his arms through the enemy, hewing his
way right and left. And, moreover, Lord
Robert did tell how that the blood from
that cut on the earl's temple did in truth
run down into his eyes and blind him, but
how that he dashed it back and slew the
man who wounded him, and so they escaped.</p>

<p>The next morning, as I did sally forth
with my cross-bow to have a shot at a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
screech-owl which for some nights past
had disturbed Marian's slumbers, she in
her turn having disturbed mine, I did see
Lord Denbeigh come out upon the terrace
and throw himself down along the grass,
beneath a tulip-tree, with a book. But he
read not, lying very quiet, with his head
raised up upon one hand and his elbow
sunk in the soft turf. And as the sunlight
struck through the leaves upon his
glittering hair, and his face like marble,
I could not but pause to gaze on him, so
noble looked he. But his eyes were far
away, and his thoughts with them.</p>

<p>It was for this that he did not hear my
lady coming until she stood beside him,
and her white gown brushed his cheek.
But seeing her, he leaped to his feet, and
the blood ran along his face, and then seemed
all to settle in the long wound, leaving
him more pale than before. And she said
to him,</p>

<p>"Nay, do not rise, for thou art weak yet;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
but he would not be seated, so they stood
there, side by side in the fair morning light.
And presently she puts out her hand (no
one ere reached out their hand as did my
lady), and she just lays it on his sleeve, and
saith she, "I am come to thank you&mdash;to
thank you with all my heart and soul&mdash;"
and there a sob chokes her, and she can
say no more.</p>

<p>Again the blood swept up across his
brow; and he said, "For God's love, say
no more."</p>

<p>But she answered, saying, "Nay, I have
so much to say." And she came nearer
to him for a little space; and her head
drooped downward, like a flower full of
rain. And she did knit and unknit her
white fingers as they hung before her.
And she saith, "There is no guerdon worthy
such a knight, but if an thou&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then all on a sudden did she reach out
both arms towards him, and her fair hands,
palms upward, and the scarlet leaped to her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
very brow; but she lifted her little head
proudly, albeit her eyes were dropped downward,
and she said unto him, "Take me, for
I am thine."</p>

<p>And he trembled from head to foot, and
parting his lips as though to speak, reached
out his arms and clasped her.</p>

<p>And when I realized what I had done, I
did drop my cross-bow and took to my
heels, like one followed by goblins.</p>

<p>Now, even as I hope to be saved, I but
just come to recognize that this was my
second eavesdropping. So be it. I have
vowed, and must keep my vow.</p>

<p>It was all made clear to me that night,
when Marian did relate to me how that the
Spanish woman had slain herself by swallowing
flame. At which (though mightily
pleased, God forgive me, on account of my
lady and the earl) I was more than ever
thankful that Lord Robert had escaped
alive and unwed out o' th' clutches o' th'
Spanish wench. And here it occurreth to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
me that I have not yet told that Marian
did know from the first of my lady's going
up to town dressed as her brother. This
I record more on account of its being a
marvellous instance of a woman's keeping
her tongue than to shame Marian, who
hath often read how that wives should
submit themselves unto their husbands as
unto the Lord. Howbeit, all ended so happily
that I had not the heart to scold her.</p>

<p>With the first frosts of October my lady
and the earl were wed. Methought the
queen herself could not have had a finer
wedding, and certes no woman could have
had a nobler spouse. He was yet pale
from his wounds, but most soldierly of
bearing and proud of carriage. He was
clad all in white, like my lady. A more
beauteous apparel I have never seen.</p>

<p>His doublet was of cloth of silver, with
a close jerkin of white satin embroidered
in silver and little pearls. His girdle and
the scabbard of his sword were of cloth of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
silver, with golden buckles. His poniard
and sword were hilted and mounted in
gold, together with many blazing orders
and richer devices that I know not how
to enumerate.</p>

<p>My lady's gown was all of white satin,
sewn down the front with little pearls, like
those on my lord's jerkin, and her ruff was
of soft lace, not stiff, as was the fashion,
but falling about her bosom most modestly
and becomingly. Lord Robert, methinks,
was eke as goodly, after his way, as either
his sister or Lord Denbeigh, being close
clad from head to foot in crimson sarcenet,
slashed all with cloth of gold. My lady had
given me some suiting clothes for the occasion;
and as for Marian, methought in her
new gown of sea-green taffeta, with her
new ruff and head-gear, that she looked as
fair a matron as any mother of fine lads in
all England.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>


<h3><br />IV.</h3>

<p>Seven months they had been wed, and it
was May again. Methought such love had
never been on earth since Eden. 'Twas
gladness but to see them. And all, moreo'er,
was so well with Lord Robert, who,
folks did say, was in mighty great favor at
court, and like to become a shining light in
the land.</p>

<p>'Twas on a May morning. The trees
were a-lilt with birds, and the sound of
waters set all the winds a-singing. All at
once comes my lord, and sets his hand on
my shoulder. Then know I that something
dire hath happened. And he saith,
"Friend, where is thy mistress?"</p>

<p>And I tell him that she is out among
her roses.</p>

<p>Then saith he all at once, "The Queen
hath sent for me&mdash;I must to war."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>And I could do naught but stare at him.
And he said to me: "In an hour I must
be gone. Say naught to thy mistress. I
will go don a suiting dress, and do thou
bring me my sword and give it into my
hand."</p>

<p>And he went, returning shortly, and I
gave him the sword. It was then that we
heard the voice of my lady without, and
she sang a song of the spring-tide. The
words I have ne'er forgot, though I did
but hear them once:</p>

<div class='poem'>"For O! For O!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The cowslips blow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And the ground's all gold below me;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The speedwell's eye</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Peers up so bli'</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">I swear it seems to know me!</span><br />
<br />
"The lady-smocks<br />

<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The humble bee</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Consorts wi' me</span><br />

</div>

<div class='unindent'>And as the earl listened methought he
would have fallen, grasping my shoulder,
old man as I was, and bending down
his head upon it. And I did stay him
with my arm, as though he had been
my very son&mdash;for old age is father to all
men.</div>

<p>So my lady comes in, with her gold hair
blowing, and her white kirtle full of red
roses, and seeing her lord goes to meet
him. But when she noted the soldierly
fashioning of his dress, and the sword girt
at his thigh, she opened her lips as though
to cry out, but no sound escaped them.
And her kirtle slipped from her hold, and
the red roses lay between them like a pool
of blood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Then she saith unto him, "Tell me.
Quick, quick!"</p>

<p>And he lifts her to him, and saith,
"Sweetheart, my Queen hath bidden me
come fight for her and for my country."</p>

<p>And she saith naught, only clasps him.</p>

<p>But by-and-by she cries out, saying, "Go
not! Go not! Else wilt thou kill me."
And so speaking, falls like one dead at
her lord's feet.</p>

<p>Then I, running like one distraught to
fetch Marian, do tilt pell-mell into Lord
Robert, who hath come down to Amhurste
for a week or so of rest.</p>

<p>"Heydey!" quoth he. "What Jack-a-lent
hath frighted thee?" And I told him all.
Never a word said he, but went straightway
and got upon his horse, and clapped
spurs to its sides, and so out of sight.</p>

<p>And all that night my lady lay nigh to
death, so that there was ne'er a thought in
the breast of any for another soul. Therefore
Lord Robert was not missed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Ere two days were past came a man with
despatches, and we found out how that Lord
Robert had substituted himself for the earl
(having acquainted the Queen with the circumstances&mdash;and
he being, moreover, so
great a favorite), and how the Queen had
granted Lord Denbeigh leave to remain in
England a while longer.</p>

<p>And so his lordship was with his lady
when their child was born, but Lord Robert
was killed in the wars.</p>

<p>They grieved sore for him, and for many
weeks would not be comforted. And even
it was said that the Queen mourned for
him, and did banish all festivities from
court for the space of several days.</p>

<p>But like as the stars do pale in the morning
sky, so pales the orb of sorrow before
the rays of the great sun, happiness.</p>

<p>And though he was ne'er forgotten, and
though the tears would spring to my lady's
eyes heard she but his name mentioned,
yet she did smile again and was happy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>It chanced but this morning that Marian
and I, leaning from the window that overlooks
the east terrace, did see a most winsome
sight.</p>

<p>'Twas a fair morning, and May again,
and on such mornings as these my lady
would go forth on the east terrace with the
child. And there grow all such sweet flowers
as my lady loves&mdash;the red mule-pinks,
and dame's-violets, such as are sweet o' evenings,
but marvellous fair to look upon both
by sunlight and moonlight. And the south
wall was all thick with the yellow violets, so
that my lady's head looked like the head
o' a saint against a golden platter. And
there did my lady sit, on a quaintly
wrought bench, with the little lord.</p>

<p>And this morning, when she was seated,
and the babe curled against her bosom, and
Marian and myself thinking o' the pictures
o' the Virgin Mary and the blessed Jesus
(saving that my lady's kirtle was all of
white and gold, like the lilies, knotted in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
her waistband), she looked up on a sudden,
and lo! there was the master coming along
over the grass towards her. When he saw
who it was that sat there, he doffed his
plumed hat like as though it had been the
Virgin Mary for very truth, and he paused
a minute, but then came on.</p>

<p>When my lady saw him who he was,
there came a fair red o'er all the white o'
her throat and face; ay, and withal over
her very bosom. And she put up one
white hand, with her wedding-ring on't,
and made as though she would shield the
sun from the babe's eyes.</p>

<p>And all this time my lord came slowly
over the grass, as though the sweet sight
did pleasure him both far and near. And
when he was approached, he stood, still
with his hat in his hand, and looked down
at the babe and its mother, and was silent.</p>

<p>Then the child, feeling mayhap that its
father was near, twisted over towards him,
reaching out its waxen arm, and smiled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
right knowingly; whereat my lord did pluck
the great plume out o' his hat and lay it
across my lady's bosom; moreover, he knelt
and put an hand on the babe, but his arm
he held about his wife.</p>

<p>Then did she draw both my lord and the
child to her, and pressed them against her,
but her face she lifted Godwards.</p>

<p>And something spoke within our hearts
that we turned and left the window.</p>

<h2>THE FARRIER LASS O' PIPING<br />
PEBWORTH.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Humfrey Lemon</span>, meeting Bered Turnip,
before the "Red Deer," doth speak
as follows:<br /><br /><br /></p>



<p>Whom have we here? Well, well, by
my troth! 'tis none other than Bered Turnip,
the farrier, as I do live! Come for
an alms-drink, comrade. Would I had as
many gold-pieces as we have burnt alnights
i' this very tavern! And is it thus
we meet after all these years? It doth
seem but yesterday that we supped under
this very roof as juvenals. Dost thou
mind thee o' the night that we gave old
Gammer Lick-the-Dish a bath in his own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
sack, for that he served us in a foul jerkin?
By'r lay'kin, those were days! Well, well,
to meet thee thus! Though, believe it or
not, as thou wilt, I had such a pricking i'
my thumbs but an hour gone that I was of
a mind to roar you like any babe with a
pin in his swaddling-bands. Thou wast
my beau-peer i' those times; and we are
kin by profession, moreover. How be Mistress
Turnip and thy eight lads? Ha!
ha! Dost remember how old Anthony
Butter&mdash;him who was gardener at Amhurste
Castle, ye mind&mdash;dost thou remember
in what spite he held thee because o'
those eight little salads o' thine? A always
said a married with an eye to a's
posterity; and o' my word a's been cockeyed
e'er since, for's posterity has e'er kept
him on the lookout: never chick or child
hath Mistress Butter given him.</p>

<p>Quoth he to me one day, a-setting of
's chin in 's thumb and forefinger (thou
mind'st his solemn ways)&mdash;quoth he to me,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
"Lemon," quoth he, "would I knew why
the Lord doth seem to look with a more
bounteous favor on such as are farriers,
than on such as be followers of other
trades; for methinks, what with thee, and
Turnip, and Job Long-pate, who bides in
Dancing Marston, England will owe the
chief o' her future population to blacksmiths."
I quoth, to humor him, quoth I,
"Belike, Master Butter," quoth I, "the Almighty
hath gotten wisdom by experience,
and doth purpose to put no further trust
in gardeners." Whereat he waxed so
wrathful, that for the sake o' my breeches
I took to my heels. But, Lord! it doth
seem as though a had a spite against th'
very children o' others. Thou mindest
my Keren? By'r lay'kin, 'twill not stick i'
my old pate how that thou hast not been
in these parts since my Keren could 'a'
walked under a blackberry-bramble without
so much as tousling her tresses. Well, a
grew up a likely lass, I can tell thee!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Sure thou mindest why we&mdash;my wife and
I&mdash;did come to call her Keren? Go to!
Thou dost! 'Tis the jest o' th' place to
this day. Well, then, if thou dost not, I'll
be at the pains o' telling thee; for methinks
'twas a wise thought. We did
christen her Keren-Happuch; "for," quoth
my wife, "when that we be pleased with
her, we can call her Keren&mdash;which is as
sweet-sounding a name as a maid can have;
and, on the other hand, when we be wroth
with her, we can call her Happuch&mdash;which
sure would be a rough name even for thy
trotting mare Bellibone." Ha! ha! And
thereby, comrade, hangs another tale, as
Master Shakespeare was wont to say. My
wife, thou must know, hath e'er been a
loyal admirer o' our gracious Queen, and
it comes to her ears one day as how her
Majesty did ride a-horseback most excellent
well. Naught would do but that I must
let Mistress Lemon mount for a ride upon
my gray mare Bellibone. Now Bellibone,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
though as willing a nag as ever ambled,
did think far more o' getting to her journey's
end than o' the manner in which she
did accomplish the journey; and, I will say,
a trotted as though a was for breaking
th' stones on th' Queen's highway, instead
o' getting o'er 'em. Well, I did what I
could to dissuade Mistress Lemon from
her enterprise, but a was as firm as one o'
my surest driven nails in a new shoe. So
a let her go. Couldst thou but 'a' seen her
when she was returned an hour after!
Ha! ha! ha! a was for breaking my head
with my own pincers.</p>

<p>"Dost thou call that devil's-riding-horse
'Bellibone?'" quoth she, with what breath
there was left to her. "By my troth, I think
she hath not another bone in her whole
body besides her backbone!"</p>

<p>But I spake o' Keren. Thou knowest
that even as a lass she had a sharp tongue
o' her own&mdash;as keen as a holly leaf, by my
troth. So be it. 'Twas one day nigh unto<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Martlemas that old Butter did undertake to
chide her for conducting herself after the
manner o' a lad rather than o' a lass.</p>

<p>Quoth she to him, a-setting of her little
black pate to one side, and of her little
brown arms akimbo&mdash;quoth she, "Since the
Lord hath not made me a lad," quoth she,
"I cannot more than act like one; and so
I will do!"</p>

<p>Quoth he, "Thou hast a sour name,
a bitter tongue, and a peppery temper,
jade; and the two last be not gifts o' the
Lord."</p>

<p>"And thou," quoth she, "hast a mustard
conceit, for right sure am I that 'tis big
enough for a goose to roost in! And
whether th' Lord hath given it to thee or
not, I'm glad I have 't not," quoth she;
for she had heard it read, in some meeting
whither her mother would sometimes
take her, of how the fowls o' the air did
lodge i' th' branches o' the mustard-plant.
Well, by'r lay'kin, th' village hath ne'er forgot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
that to this day, and that I'll prove
thee when we be through drinking!</p>

<p>What hath become o' her? Go to!
Sure thou knowest that? Well, well 'tis a
tale to make a play of. I've often thought,
had Master Shakespeare known of 't, how
he would 'a' fashioned it into a jolly play.
Tell thee of 't? What! art in earnest?
By the mass, then, thou must drink again.
Come, fill up, fill up. What there! a cup
o' the amber drink for Master Turnip!</p>

<p>Let me see: how old was th' lass when
thou didst set forth on thy jauntings?
Some two years, methinks. And she was
fourteen on the first day o' March i' that
year wherein she did sauce old Butter with
some o' 's own wit for gibing at her for a
tomboy. O' my word, man, th' old fellow
was not far i' th' wrong. If e'er th' angel
o' life did make an error i' th' distributing
o' souls, 'twas on the night Keren was
brought into this world. And a say that
with a cause, moreover; for th' same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
night, mark you, one Mistress Mouldy,
over the way, was brought to bed o' a
man-child. That's neither here nor there.
Herein doth lie the singularity. That
child did grow up to knit stockings i' th'
door-way like any wench; Peter Mouldy's
th' name, and a plays a part i' th' story I'm
about to relate to thee. Ne'er in all thy
travels hast thou e'er seen so crack-brain a
wench as my Keren! Lord! it set thy
head to swimming did she but enter a
room. She had no more stability o' motion
than a merry-go-round; and she was
that brown, a bun looked pale i' th' comparison,
when she did lift it to her mouth to
eat it. A strapping jade, and strong as
any lad o' her age i' th' village. In her
seeming she took neither after her mother
nor after me, though she was a comely
wench as wenches go&mdash;hair as black as a
January night in stormy weather, and eyes
as big and as bright and as yellow (o' my
word)&mdash;as yellow as two crown pieces!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
They looked out from under her thick eyebrows
like sunlight peeping from a heavy
cloud. And she was made like a lad for
suppleness. Taller than her mother by
head and shoulders, and within a full inch
o' my forelock. By'r lay'kin! how she
could sing too! She would troll thee a
ditty i' th' voice o' a six-foot stripling, but
for a' that, as sweet as bells far away on a
still noon in summer-tide. And she was
always getting hold o' saucy songs, and putting
them to tunes o' her own invention.
A could 'a' had aye the lads i' th' village,
had a wanted 'em; but, Lord! a had one
sweetheart one day, and another the next,
till they were one and all for murdering
or marrying her. But she would none o'
'em. 'Twas one summer's day, her mother
being gone to th' village, that she did set
about to brew some sack; and as she did
stand by the big pot while it cooled, to see
that naught fell into 't, up comes Master
Peter Mouldy with his knitting, and grins<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
at her across the caldron, after the fashion
o' a horse eating briers. She not noticing
him, quoth he,</p>

<p>"Good-morrow, sweet Mistress Lemon."</p>

<p>Saith she, not looking at him,</p>

<p>"Thou liest."</p>

<p>"How, mistress?" saith he, with his
mouth as wide as a church door on a
Sunday.</p>

<p>"Why, for calling a lemon sweet," saith
she, "when all the world doth know that it
is sour."</p>

<p>Thereat he did fall a-grinning again.</p>

<p>"Sweet, sweet mistress Keren," quoth he,
"'tis thee I praise, and not thy name. And
I will wager that thou art not sour, Mistress
Keren."</p>

<p>"How wilt thou find out, either to lose
or to win thy wager?" quoth she.</p>

<p>"Thus!" quoth he. And, o' my word,
the homespun got his arms about her, knitting
and all (though I would 'a' laid two
cows and a lamb they couldn't 'a' reached<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
about her pretty waist), and smacked her
right heartily full on her red mouth.</p>

<p>Well, comrade, that something would
happen I knew full well; but when she did
up with him by the seat o' his breeches
and the collar o' his jerkin, and did souse
him head first into the pot o' sack, methought
I would 'a' burst in sunder, like
Judas Iscariot (meaning no blasphemy).</p>

<p>And when he was climbed out, spluttering
and white with terror, she did fish out
his hat with his big knitting-needles, and
did set it upon his head, and did thrust
him outside, and did shut the door in 's
face. But never a word said she from first
to last. Then methought in verity I would
'a' split in twain from top to toe, like the
veil o' the temple (meaning no blasphemy,
as I will swear on th' book). And when
she caught sight o' me she too fell a-laughing,
and quoth she to me, "I have spoiled
a good brew for thee, father, but 'twas
worth the paying for." And therewith she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
did out with the worth o' the sack from
her purse, which she always carried in her
bosom, after a fashion inherited from her
mother, and counted down the silver into
my hand. I took it, for I ever strove to
bring up my children in the ways o' honesty;
and certes she had spoiled the contents
o' the caldron by turning it into a
bath-tub for Master Mouldy. Well, 'twas
th' talk o' th' village for full a month;
scarce did young Mouldy dare put out his
nose from behind the lattice o' his mother's
cottage. But th' other lads seemed to fall
more daft about the lass than aye afore.</p>

<p>Now, my wife's sister had a daughter,
called Ruth, and in all things was she most
different from my Keren. A'd a head as
yellow as Keren's eyes, and eyes as brown
as Keren's skin, and a skin as white as
Keren's teeth; and a was slim and tender-looking,
like a primrose that hath but just
ventured out on a day in early spring.
Moreover, she was a timid, sweet-voiced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
creature&mdash;the kind o' wench that makes
even a weak man feel strong, ye mind,
comrade. But a was ne'er o'er-civil to my
lass. Neither did Keren waste much love
upon her; she said from th' very start that
th' hussy had a sly tongue; "and a sly
tongue," saith she, "doth ever mate with a
false heart," saith she; "and from such a
marriage what offspring can ye look for,
unless it be for mischief?" saith she.</p>

<p>They had not much to do the one with
the other, however, until the coming of
Robert Hacket to Pebworth. And a was
as fine a lad as e'er caused a lass to don
her Sunday kirtle on a Saturday. 'Twas
said as how he had met with Ruth while
that she was on a visit to her aunt in
Dancing Marston, and that he had come
to Pebworth to wed with her. All would
'a' been well had not it come to Keren's
ears how that Mistress Ruth said that she
would bring Master Hacket to see her
cousin Keren, but that she did not want<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
her sweetheart to be out with her family
ere that he had married into it; meaning
neither more nor less than that my Keren
was a shame unto her name by reason o'
her romping ways.</p>

<p>"The cat!" quoth Keren, waxing as red
as any damask rose for very anger; "the
little, spiteful cat! But I'll cut her claws
for her! Do thou bide and mark me, father.
Ay, I'll serve her and her Robert in
such wise they'll go to their graves remembering."</p>

<p>Now, 'twas the very next day that the
lads and lasses o' the village did crown her
harvest-queen, and all Bidford was out to
see 't. And very queen she looked, too,
borne aloft in a throne made all o' dark red
roses, and her dark curls crowned with a
wreath o' corn and o' poppies, that shined
in the sunlight like to gold strewn all with
rubies. She wore a new kirtle of white
wool, and her brown throat rose from her
white kerchief like as a frozen wood-dove's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
dusky breast doth peep from new-fallen
snow.</p>

<p>And Mistress Ruth walked beside her
as one o' her maids o' honor. And they
twain did remind me of naught so much
as of a lamb trotting by the side of a forest
doe&mdash;the one so meek and white, and the
other so free and brown, with great eyes
ever moving, and head aloft.</p>

<p>There, moreover, walked Master Hacket.
He was as brown as my Keren, and nearly
half as tall again; and he had eyes like
pools o' water under a night heaven,
wherein two stars have drowned themselves,
as 'twere, and brows as black and
straight as a sweep o' cloud across an evening
sky. Ruth walked at his side, all glittering
with her unbound hair, like to a
sunbeam that follows a dark stream. And
I saw that they talked together, and nodded
as though agreeing on something, and
looked together at my lass where she sat
on her flower-throne with her poppy-crown,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
and her lips like poppies. And all at once
she turned and saw them, and her lips
parted over her white teeth in a sudden
smile, as when a kirtle o' red silk doth tear
over a white petticoat beneath; and she
turned away; but I could see that she
laughed in her brown throat, as a bird
sings sometimes for its own hearkening
ere trolling for the whole forest. So I said
to myself, "'Ware, 'ware, my little spring
lamb; there is trouble ahead for thee.
Thou wilt not win thy Boaz so easily as
thou dost think, my little Ruth."</p>

<p>Now, when they were come to the
fields, and the maids seated under some
elm-trees, and all the lads fallen to 't with
their sickles, while that they were reaping
the glistening corn my Keren doth leap
to her feet, and she calls out,</p>

<p>"I know not the name o' yonder man,
but I do know that I can give him a lesson
in reaping!"</p>

<p>So forthwith up jumps she, and, striding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
out into the sunlit meadow, jerks young
Hacket's sickle from his hand, and, having
turned back the sleeves o' her smock,
stands well upon her shapely legs and begins
to reap.</p>

<p>Now, methought I had ne'er in all my
life seen anything more pleasing to look
upon. The wind blew down her thick
locks about her, so that she was wrapped
in a mantle worthy any queen; while with
every sweep o' her strong brown arms the
tumbling grain did fall like gold about her,
so that she seemed to be trampling upon
her treasures after a manner truly royal.
Also a red came into her shadowy cheeks,
like as though a scarlet flower tossed into
a clear brown stream should rise slowly
upward beneath the limpid surface and
shine a-through. And all at once she
ceased, and came back towards the young
man, and returned his sickle unto him.
And she said, smiling,</p>

<p>"Take thou thy blade, for I have not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
only reaped the grain, but I have reaped
the reward of my bragging as well." And,
behold! when I was come up to them with
a drink o' water in a gourd, there was the
blood falling down upon her white kirtle,
as though the poppies in her crown had
melted in the sunlight and did stain her
garment.</p>

<p>He did cry out, saying, "O' my word,
lass, thou art deeply hurt. Let me but
look at it."</p>

<p>She saith unto him (winding her arm
about in her long hair), "Nay, 'tis nothing,
and belike if thou look upon it 'twill spoil
thy dinner: so here's to thy health, and my
father will bind it for me."</p>

<p>Then, when we were retired again into
the shade, and I had torn a strip off of her
kirtle wherewith to stanch the blood, she
laughed outright, and saith,</p>

<p>"By my troth, father! I do verily believe
thou thinkest me awkward without a
purpose."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>"Purpose!" saith I; for I could not believe
my ears. "How dost thou mean&mdash;purpose?"</p>

<p>"That's neither here nor there," saith
she, still laughing. "But I'll lay thee my
heifer, father, that Mistress Ruth's sweetheart
cometh on the morrow to inquire
after Mistress Ruth's cousin Keren."</p>

<p>Wherewith she did make me a deep
courtesy, and did get her back to the other
lasses ere I could reply.</p>

<p>Well, as I live, and must some day die,
and do hope when I do die to get to
heaven, I was so taken aback with the
hussy's cunning I could do naught but
stand and stare after her for some minutes.</p>

<p>And on the morrow he did come, and
on the day after that he came, and yet a
third day and he was under my roof again.</p>

<p>Then saith my wife, after that his third
visit was o'er, and speaking to Keren as
she sat spinning i' th' door-way,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
"Happuch," saith she, "thou art serving
thy cousin Ruth a very jade's trick."</p>

<p>Then, hearing as how she did call her
"Happuch," I did prick up my ears, as
'twere; for I knew there was anger brewing.</p>

<p>"Thou art very free with thy words to-day,
mother," quoth the maid, a-spinning
very quickly.</p>

<p>"Not so free as thou art with thy favors
to the sweetheart o' another lass," replied
her mother.</p>

<p>"How dost thou know he is the sweetheart
o' another lass?" saith Keren.</p>

<p>"If an he be not," quoth her mother,
who, though not half so big as her child,
was in nowise less valiant&mdash;"if an he be
not," quoth she, "'tis time he were."</p>

<p>"And for why?" saith Keren.</p>

<p>"Thou knowest as well as I do, Happuch,"
saith my wife; whereat up started
my crack-brain in a fine fury.</p>

<p>"Why wilt thou call me that vile name,
when thou knowest how it maddens me?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
saith she, hurling her spindle upon the
floor, and tightening both her pretty hands
so that they looked like balls o' her own
brown yarn.</p>

<p>"For that I am not pleased with thee,
Happuch," saith her mother, with all composure,
looking at the linen as she washed
it, with her head cocked to one side.</p>

<p>"There again!" shouted my wildfire,
stamping with her foot. "Why didst thou
not call me Beelzebub and have done
with 't?"</p>

<p>"For the reason," quoth her mother,
calmly, "that neither Beel nor Zebub is a
suiting name for a woman, and, furthermore,
that thou art not the Devil, though
thou dost act like him on occasions."</p>

<p>"Wife, wife," put in I, seeing that the
girl was like to split with rage, "speak
gentler to Keren."</p>

<p>"To Happuch," saith she.</p>

<p>"Speak gentler to the girl," saith I, hoping
to compromise, as 'twere.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>"Happuch," saith my wife again.</p>

<p>"Well, well," saith I, still hoping to split
the difference, so that I would have neither
my wife nor my daughter upon me, "if
thou wouldst only speak gentler to Keren-Happuch,
thou&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To Happuch," saith my wife a third
time; whereat the lass did bounce out o'
the house without more ado, and spent that
night with a friend o' her own, by name
one Mistress Meg Titmouse.</p>

<p>"Wife," saith I unto her later, hoping
to draw her into converse concerning
Keren, so that I might reason with her
as to her treatment o' th' lass&mdash;"wife,"
saith I, amiably, and, as I thought, in a
manner most winsome, "wherefore didst
thou speak to Keren as thou didst this
morning?"</p>

<p>"I spake to Happuch," saith my wife,
"because I did choose so to do. And as
for the why o' that wherefore, though thou
shouldst smirk till doomsday like a dog<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
scratching his ear, ne'er wilt thou get it
out o' me!"</p>

<p>Then saith I, being justly angered, as I
think thou wilt admit, comrade&mdash;saith I,</p>

<p>"Thou art welcome to keep thy counsel!"
saith I.</p>

<p>And I followed the example set me by
my vixen, and did spend more than half
the night at this very tavern.</p>

<p>Well, the next morning, as I did pass
out on my way to my forge, whom should
I see in the garden but my Keren and
Master Robert Hacket! and if e'er a woman
was possessed o' a devil, 'twas just that
lass o' mine then, comrade. She had
caused young Hacket to climb up into a
pear-tree, and while that he was up there
she did bear away the ladder by which he
had mounted, and she saith to him,</p>

<p>"Now, Master Robin, I am going to
sing thee a song. Wilt thou listen?"</p>

<p>"With all my heart," saith he. So he
leaned on his elbow, stretched out like a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
young panther along the limb o' th' tree,
and looked down on her. Now, as I live,
down went that jade on her knees in the
grass, and she lifts up her two pretty hands
to him as though in prayer, and thus sings
she (I knew the song by heart):</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Listen, Robin, while I woo.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">This world's stale with repetition:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I'll not do as others do;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Haste thee, love, to my tuition.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Robin, I'll make love to you,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">As men to other maidens do.</span><br />
<br />
"'Oh, what eyes my Robin hath!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">April fields own no such blue;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In the luscious aftermath</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">There's no flower so fair to view.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Robin, Robin, hear me woo.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Thus upon my knees I sue:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">O' my word I'll harry thee</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Like as men their sweethearts do.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Robin, as I live I'm true:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Will you wed me, Robin?&mdash;Will you?'"</span><br />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, what chanced thereupon I think
thou wilt agree with me, comrade, in saying
it did but serve her right. Down falls
he like a ripe pomewater at her side, and
takes her about the waist, and sets his
mouth to hers (all in a twink, comrade;
thou hadst not time to shape thy mouth
for a whistle ere 'twas all done, or verily
my mouth had given forth something besides
whistling), and saith he,</p>

<p>"That will I, lass; an' if thou be not
my wife ere that snail-coming new moon
doth thrust out her horns, my name is not
Hacket, nor will thine be!"</p>

<p>Now, comrade, though it doth shame me
verily so to speak o' mine own flesh, I saw
by her pretending to push him away that
she did mightily relish his kisses; for, by
my troth! had she sought to scuffle with
him 'twould 'a' been as snug an encounter
as when day and night wrestle for the last
bit o' a June sky.</p>

<p>And she saith to him, feigning to scowl,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
"How now, thou rapscallion! dost thou
dare?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay," quoth he, "in verity I do!"
quoth he. And in verity a did, too.</p>

<p>But just as I was consulting with the
Lord how to act, He having had even
a greater experience with wayward children
than myself (may He pardon me
if I be too free with His holy name!)&mdash;just,
I say, as I was asking Him to show
me in what wise to proceed, up goes her
hand, and she gives him a sound cuff o' th'
ear (young Hacket's ear&mdash;not the Lord's;
may He pardon me if so it sounded), and
she saith,</p>

<p>"Take that for striving to make a fool
out o' an honest girl! I know thy goings
on with Ruth Visor," saith she. "Thou'lt
ne'er blind me with thy pretty speecheries."
And a was o'er th' palings and out
o' sight like a wind-blown leaf.</p>

<p>Then did young Hacket come to th'
fence and lean upon it with both his arms,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
and support his chin with a thumb on
either side o't, and saith he,</p>

<p>"Methinks she'd 'a' made a better warrior
than a wife," saith he; "but when she
hath ta'en off the edge o' her warlike spirit
in fighting for her freedom," saith he, "why,
then," saith he, "I'll marry her!" So saith
he&mdash;every word o't. By my troth, comrade,
an I had not had so much the advantage
by having my nippers in my hand, I would
'a' thrashed him then and there. But,
"fair play" being my motto, and having
my nippers, as I saith, I forbore; yea, I
forbore, and walked away unseen of him.
And, o' my word, I was much angered
with myself for not being more angry with
th' wench.</p>

<p>"For," saith I, out loud, that I might
be impressed by the sound as well as by
the knowledge o' th' fact&mdash;"for," saith I,
a-hammering away on a shoe for Joe Pebbles's
brown nag King Edward (though I
had often reasoned with Joe on account o'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
th' name, first because o' its irreverence,
second on account o' th' horse not being
that kind o' a horse, as 'twas a mare)&mdash;"for,"
saith I, as I made th' shoe, saith I,
"'tis sure a great wickedness to steal a
lass's sweetheart away from her!" saith I.
And so 'twas; but, for all I could do, I
could not feel angered with the hussy.</p>

<p>But that day when she did fetch me my
dinner, being finished, I did pull down th'
sleeves o' my shirt, and wiped off my leathern
apron, and quoth I to her,</p>

<p>"Lass, come here and sit upon my knee."</p>

<p>So she comes right willingly, being fond
o' me to an extent that did oft seem to
astony the mother that bore her (seeing
that <i>she</i> was fond o' naught save her own
way); she comes, and she perches upon my
knee (as sometimes thou shalt see a hawk
rest wings on a bull's back), and she kittles
my throat with her long brown fingers,
and hugs me about the neck (the jade! a
knew I was for scolding her), and saith she,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
"Well, father, here be I." Methinks I
can hear her say it now, as soft as any
little toddler come for a kiss. "Here be
I," she saith; and with that she fills all my
face with her curls (the jade! a saw that
in my eye which a did not care to face).
"Here be I," saith she.</p>

<p>"Ay," saith I, speaking in a gruff voice;
"and now that here thou be," saith I, "I'll
tell thee what I want of thee."</p>

<p>"Thou canst want naught that I will
not do," saith she. (The jade! a had a
way with her to 'a' made Bess herself yearn
for matrimony.) But I was stanch; I was
stanch, comrade. Saith I,</p>

<p>"Methinks thy mother was right to speak
to thee as yesternight she did," saith I; "for
I saw thee strive to graft a pear-tree with a
branch o' th' tree o' knowledge," saith I.</p>

<p>"Then," saith she, hot as my forge all in
a breath, and bouncing from my knee&mdash;"then
thou wast an eavesdropper!" saith
she.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>"Even as the Lord afore me," saith I,
not over-pleased at her sauciness. "And
being in some sort thy Creator, and thou
having set up for thyself an Eden in my
garden," saith I, "who hath a greater right
than I to watch over thee?" saith I.</p>

<p>Then she not answering me, thus did I
continue:</p>

<p>"Why dost thou not take unto thyself
an husband," quoth I, "to do both thyself
and thy parents a credit?"</p>

<p>"Show me such an one," saith she, "and
I do promise thee to wed him."</p>

<p>"There, then," quoth I, "is Davy Short hose,
the poulterer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A bangled-eared buffoon as ever lived!"
quoth she; "and a fool into the bargain."</p>

<p>"So be it," saith I; for I was set upon
keeping my temper. "What dost thou say
to Beryamen Piggin, the brewer?"</p>

<p>"A say if ever a piggin was in sore need o'
a new link, 'tis that one," saith she. "And,
what's more, I'll not serve for 't," saith she.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>"How, then, of Nanfan Speckle, the tanner?"</p>

<p>"A's as pied as a's name," quoth she,
"both soul and body."</p>

<p>"There be Jezreel Spittlewig, the joiner."</p>

<p>"Methinks," quoth she, "if a'd do a little
joining to a's own shackling body, a might
hold together long enough to go through
the marriage ceremony," saith she. "Howbeit,
I'm not a-sure of 't."</p>

<p>"Well, then, Jack Stirthepot, the chair-mender."</p>

<p>"A'd have to stir th' pot with a witch
ere a brewed a wedding with me," quoth
she.</p>

<p>"What sayest to Reuben Puff, the
tinker?"</p>

<p>"If I say so much as a word to any one
o' em," cried she, snatching up the pail
wherein she had brought my victuals,
"may thy first grandchild be born without
a tongue!" saith she. And out she
went.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Then quoth I to myself, quoth I, "Lemon,"
quoth I, "the jade's in love with th'
crack&mdash;no more, no less." And I said further,
said I, "Bodykins!" said I, a-shoeing
of King Edward with all my might, "by
cock and pye!" said I, "an a wants him
let a have him. 'Tis more than his <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'desert'">dessert</ins>,
I'll warrant," so quoth I. "And as for
Dame Visor's hussy, let her learn to bridle
her tongue," quoth I. And 'twas just here
that wench Keren did creep up and take
me about the neck, as I was a-filing of King
Edward's hoof.</p>

<p>"Father," saith she, "I cry thee pardon
if I have sauced thee; but dost not mind
the rhyme thou art so fond of?&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Shoe the horse, and shoe the mare,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But let the little colt go bare.'</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>Seek not to chide me, father, and ne'er will
my heels bring hurt to any."</div>

<p>Then off was she again ere I had spat
forth my mouthful o' nails to answer her.</p>

<p>But that evening as I came home, about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the going down o' th' sun, I did hear voices
i' th' kitchen, and, looking in at th' window,
behold, there was that hussy Ruth a-plucking
of Keren by th' kirtle, and Keren a-holding
of a pan o' milk above her head, as
though she had half a mind to souse her
cousin in 't.</p>

<p>And saith she, "Get to thy feet, wench.
This is neither a church, nor am I th' Lord."</p>

<p>But th' girl (who seemed to be in trouble
o' some sort) fell a-sobbing, and saith she,</p>

<p>"Cousin, cousin, I know I have used
thee ill, but all my joy is in him. If thou
takest him from me, better didst thou take
my life, for he is more to me than life."</p>

<p>Then quoth my lass, "Shame on thee
to say it o' any man, worthy or unworthy!"</p>

<p>"Oh, shame enough have I, cousin!"
quoth the poor wench&mdash;"shame to 'a' lost
him, and shame that I should plead with
another to give him back to me!"</p>

<p>"Go to!" saith Keren; "go to! I have
not got him to give him back to thee."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thou hast!" saith Ruth; "thou hast!&mdash;he
is thine, soul and body&mdash;soul and body!
And thou dost not care; and I care&mdash;oh, I
care so that I know not how to word it!"</p>

<p>(Every word that passed between 'em is
as clear in my mind as though 'twere but
yesterday it all happened.)</p>

<p>"I say shame on thee to say so," saith
my lass again.</p>

<p>But the wench still hung about her, and
would not let go, and she saith,</p>

<p>"Oh, cousin, cousin, cousin, doth it not
show thee in what straits I am, that I come
to thee for succor? Rather had I died,
one week agone, than ask thee for thy
hand though I were drowning. And sure
'tis less than thy hand for which I ask thee
now, sith it be for a man who is less to
thee than the littlest finger on that hand,
but who is more to me than the heart in
my wretched body! And a had vowed to
wed me; and 'twas next month we were to
be wed; and all so happy&mdash;my father and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
my mother so pleased, and his folks do like
me well; and my wedding-gown all sewn
and lain away, and the ribbons for my
shoes, and some kickshaws for th' new
house; and all we so glad, and all going
so smooth, and we twain so loving; for,
oh, he did love me the once! he did love
me the once! And now&mdash;now&mdash;now&mdash;"
And here did she fall a-weeping in such
wise that never another word could she
say. And she sate down on the kitchen
floor, and hid all her pretty head (for
pretty 'twas, though I liked her not)&mdash;hid
it all in the skirt o' her kirtle.</p>

<p>Then stood my lass quite still, and her
face like the milk in her pan, and she looks
down on th' hussy, as a horse might look
down on a kitten which it hath unwitting
trampled on, and she saith,</p>

<p>"I would I knew whether or no thou
speakest the truth!"</p>

<p>Then saith the wench, a-reaching up her
clasped hands to heaven&mdash;saith she,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
"May God forever curse me an I do
not!"</p>

<p>"Take not God's name in vain," saith
my lass, sharply, and went and set down
her pan o' milk on the cupboard. And
again she stands, slowly wiping her hands
on her apron, and looking down at th' girl,
who hath once more covered all her face
in her petticoat; and by-and-by she saith
to her,</p>

<p>"What is 't thou wouldst have me do?"</p>

<p>"Give me back my Robin! give me
back my Robin!" saith the maid.</p>

<p>"Thou art welcome to him for me," saith
Keren.</p>

<p>Then fell the maid a-weeping more bitterly
than ever, and she huddled herself on
the hard floor, like a young bird that hath
fallen out o' its nest, and sobbed piteously.
And presently gets she to her feet without
a word, still a-hiding of her face in her
kirtle, and turns to go, a-feeling her way
with one o' her little hands. But when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
she hath reached th' door, and hath got
one foot on the threshold, up strides that
lass o' mine, and, taking her by the arm,
swings her back into th' room; and she
makes her sit down on a settle and take
down her kirtle from her face. And while
she is snooding up her ruffled locks, she
saith unto her,</p>

<p>"Thou art a little fool to cry so; dost
hear? What! at it again? Well, well,
God patience me! What's a body to do
with such a little ninny? There! dry your
eyes. Ye shall have your Robin, never
fear. God-a-mercy! at what art blubbering
now?" But down slipped Ruth on her
knees, and caught Keren about hers, and
she saith unto her,</p>

<p>"Heaven bless thee! thou art a good
woman! May Heaven forgive me for all
such words as e'er I have said against
thee! Bless thee! bless thee!"</p>

<p>"Bodykins!" saith my lass (having learned
some round oaths from me, I do grieve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
to say)&mdash;"bodykins!" saith she, "wilt a-hear
th' lass? I say scamper, scamper; my father'll
be coming home to sup erelong,
and I would not he found thee thus.
Away with thee! and fret no more: dost
hear? If I hear that thou hast moped any
further from this hour on, I'll not answer
either for my doings or for those o' others:
dost hear? Now scamper!" And scamper
a did, like a hare with th' hounds
upon 't.</p>

<p>So full was I o' praising my lass on her
good 'havior that I had got me from th'
lattice and was half in at the door ere I
saw what had befallen.</p>

<p>There was my madcap comrade, down
on her knees afore the settle, wi' both
hands gripped in her thick locks, and her
head bent forward on th' wooden seat;
and she made no sound, neither uttered
she any word, but a shook like water when
a heavy weight rolls past. And a drew
long breaths ever and anon, like one that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
hath been half drowned and is coming
back to life. And I knew then, I knew
then, comrade. I had thought a loved th'
boy; and I knew then. So I got me out,
without making any clatter, and I sat me
down on a bench outside th' kitchen door
to think 't over; and, by cock and pye,
man, ne'er a thought could I think for th'
tears in my eyes. Th' poor lass! th' poor
lass! It fetches th' salt into my een now
to think on 't. Well, well, what's past is
past, and God himself cannot undo 't; and
what's coming's coming, and God wunnot
hinder it an he could; so there's an end
on 't. Fill up, man, fill up! What there,
I say! Joel, I say! A quart o' sack for
Master Turnip.</p>

<p>Well, when I had thought it well o'er,
I did determine to say naught to th' lass
whatsoever; neither did I; but meseems
I was bound to o'erhear heart-breaking
words atween somebody, for th' very next
day, as I was henting th' style as leads<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
into th' lane (thou knowest the lane I
mean, comrade: 't lies atween Cowslip
Meadow and th' pool i' th' hollow&mdash;Sweethearts'
Way, they call 't)&mdash;well, as I was
getting o'er th' style&mdash;as I had just got
me o'er by one leg, after this fashion, ye
mind; as though this chair here were th'
style, and yonder chimney-place th' lane&mdash;Sweethearts'
Way, ye mind&mdash;well, as I was
half over, and Mumble, th' turnspit pup,
half under, as 'twere, I heard voices&mdash;voices,
comrade&mdash;one o' them th' voice o'
that lass o' mine, and t'other th' voice o'
young Hacket.</p>

<p>"Here be a coil," say I. "What's to do?"</p>

<p>Now the pup seemed to be filled with
the spirit o' th' Lord all on a sudden, after
th' fashion o' th' talking jackass i' th'
Scriptures; for if a didna talk a did th' next
thing to 't&mdash;a tried to. And after pulling
at my heels like as though a fiend had got
him, a scuttles into th' thicket, for no cause,
as I could see, but to give me th' benefit o'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
example. So in goes I after him. Scarce
was I settled, with a bramble down th'
back o' my neck, and some honey-bees at
work too nigh to my legs for my peace o'
mind, when they come, and both a-chattering
at th' same time like two magpies
with slit tongues.</p>

<p>"Thou didst!" quoth he. "That did I
not!" quoth she. "Thou didst, and I can
prove 't on thee!" quoth he, louder than
afore. "I tell thee I did not, and thou
canst sooner prove that Bidford Mill turns
the Avon than that I did!" quoth she.
"Wilt thou stand there and tell me i' th'
eyes that thou hast so oft looked love
into," quoth he, like a man choked with
spleen&mdash;"I say, wilt thou, Keren Lemon,
stand there and face me, Robert Hacket,
and say thou hast ne'er given me reason
to believe that thou didst love me?"
quoth he. "No more cause than I've given
to twenty better than thee!" quoth she.
"Shame on thee to say 't, thou bold-faced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
jig!" saith he; "shame on thee, I say! and
so will say all honest folk when I tell
'em o' 't." "An thou tell it, the more fool
thou," saith she; and a draws up her red
lips into a circle as though a'd had a drawstring
in 'em, and a stands and looks at
him as a used to stand and look at her
dam when she chid her for a romp. Then
all on a sudden, with such a nimbleness
as took away my breath and drove all
thoughts o' brambles and honey-bees clean
out o' my pate, he jumps aside o' her, and
gets her about th' middle, as he did that
day under th' pear-tree, and quoth he,
"Lass," quoth he, "dunnot break my heart!
dunnot break th' heart that loves ye more
than a' that's in the earth, or th' heavens
above, or th' waters below! Say ye love
me, and ha' done with 't."</p>

<p>Then gives she up herself to him for
one beat o' her own breaking heart, the
poor madcap, and she leans on him with
all her pretty self, as though begging him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
to take her against her own will, and then
a cry breaks from her, half human, and half
like th' cry o' a hurt beast, and she saith,</p>

<p>"Shame on ye, shame on ye, to forsake
th' lass ye ha' sworn to wed! Get thee
back to her straightway, or ne'er look me
i' th' face again!" And she leaps back from
him, and points with her arm&mdash;as stiff and
steady as th' tail o' a sportsman's dog&mdash;towards
th' village, and she saith again,
"Get thee back to her; get thee back to
Ruth Visor, and wed with her ere this
month be out o' the year!"</p>

<p>Then lifts he his sullen head, and looks
at her from under his brows like a smitten
blood-hound. And he saith back o' his
clamped teeth, like as 'twere a dog gnarling
in his throat, "curse ye for a false
jade!" saith he; "Curse ye for as black-hearted
a jade as e'er set an honest man
on th' road to hell!" And he turned, and
cleared th' style with one hand on 't, and
went his ways.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>And th' lass stood and looked after him
as still as though she were turned into a
pillar o' summat, after th' manner o' th'
woman i' th' holy book, and both her
hands grasping her breast. But anon
there comes a trouble o'er her face, like
as when a little wind doth run across a
gray pool at eventide, and her lips begin
to tremble, like as though some red flower
a-growing on th' bank was shaken by 't,
and her eyes all full o' woe, like th' eyes
o' some dumb thing as cannot word its
sorrow; and all at once she falls upon her
knees, and thence upon her forehead on
the ground, and afterwards to her whole
length, with her strong hands grasping th'
flowers and grass on either side o' her, and
tearing them up with th' crackling noise
that a horse makes when 't grazes. But
no sound escapes her, whether a sigh or a
groan. Well, well, comrade, I cry thee patience
if I do stumble here a bit: I cannot
think on 't now without a tightness i' my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
throat, any more than a man can think o'
th' day his first child was born to him without
his heart leaping hot in 's throat like
the flame to th' bellows. Well, well! Fill
up, I say; fill up. Remember th' old days,
when thou wast more ale-washed than th'
bottle itself. Where be I i' th' narrative?
Yea, yea, 'tis there&mdash;'tis there; I mind me
o't now.</p>

<p>No sound 'scaped her, but presently she
lifts herself up upon her knees again, with
such heaviness as a horse overburdened
doth get him to his feet, and she holds out
both her arms i' th' direction where th' lad
hath vanished, wi' th' grass and flowers yet
fast in her clinched hands; and she saith
twice, i' th' voice o' a woman in travail,</p>

<p>"Never will he know, never will he
know," she saith; and then, "Oh, God!"
she saith, a-lifting her hands again to her
breast. "Summat's broke here," she saith,
full meek, like a body that's looked a many
time on pain&mdash;"summat's broke, summat's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
broke," o'er and o'er again, as though she
would use herself to th' sound, as 'twere.
Then all at once did a deep cry break from
her. "God, O God," she saith, "show me
how to bear 't! My God, my God, show me
how to bear 't." And she got to her feet,
and sped down th' lane like one blind, running
first into th' hawthorn bushes o' this
side, then into th' quickset hedge o' th' other,
and tearing out her loosened tresses on
th' low-hanging branches o' th' pear-trees, so
that I traced her by her hair i' th' twigs,
like as thou wouldst trace any poor lost
lamb by its wool on the brambles. Now,
it did almost break my own heart to say
naught to her concerning all o't, but I
knew that 'twould but grieve without comforting
her; and rather would I 'a' had my
old heart split in twain than bring one
more ache into her true breast. So naught
say I. Never a word, comrade, from then
till now have I e'er said to her about that
time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, for all 's fine talk, Master Hacket
went no more to hell than do any other
men that marry&mdash;an' less than some, seeing
as how a did not marry a scold, which
(God forgive me, or her, or both o' us) I
have done. Yea, comrade, I will commemorate
this our first meeting in eight years
by confessing to thee that my wife (in thy
ear, comrade)&mdash;that my wife was a scold.
Sometimes I do verily think as how women
like Mistress Lemon be sent unto men
to keep 'em from pondering too heavily
concerning the absence o' marriage in
heaven. By cock and pye, man, as I live,
I do honestly believe that I would rather
be a bachelor in hell, than the husband o'
Mistress Lemon in heaven!</p>

<p>But to come back to th' lass. And, now
that I think o' th' lass, comrade, I am not
so sure that a scolding wife is not well
paid for by a duteous daughter. Nay, I
am sure o't. Methinks I would 'a' been
wed twice, and each time to a shrew, could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
I but 'a' had my Keren o' one o' 'em. Ay,
even so, even so.</p>

<p>Well, as I said&mdash;or as I meant to say&mdash;Master
Hacket wedded th' Visor hussy
within two weeks o' th' day whereon he
and my Keren had 't so fierce i' Sweethearts'
Way. And therein are two meanings:
they fell out, as is the way with
sweethearts, and they fell out i' th' lane so
called.</p>

<p>Well, well, let me crack a quart o' sack
with thee, comrade, and a joke at th' same
time.</p>

<p>A married Ruth Visor, and they went
to Lunnon Town. And on th' night o'
their wedding, as I sat by the fireside i' th'
kitchen a-mending my tools (for 'twas on
a Saturday night), and Keren abed, and
Mistress Lemon a-peeling o' leather-jackets
to make th' Sunday pie,</p>

<p>"Wife," saith I to her (a-mending my
tools, as I ha' said), "wife," quoth I, "would
'twere our lass were wed to-day!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>"For why?" saith she. No more, no less.</p>

<p>"For why?" saith I. "For the why I
think a lass is happier wed to th' man she
loves," saith I.</p>

<p>"'Tis not so I've found it," quoth she,
a-peeling of an apple so that thou couldst
'a' put his whole coat back and not 'a'
known 't had e'er come off.</p>

<p>Then quoth I, a-chuckling in my throat
at having so snared her, "Right glad am I
to find out that thou lovest me!" quoth I.</p>

<p>"If thou'st found out that," quoth she,
"thou'rt greater than Columbus," quoth
she, "for thou'st discovered something that
never was," quoth she.</p>

<p>"Bodykins, woman!" saith I, a-losing of
my temper&mdash;"then for what didst thou
marry me?"</p>

<p>"For a fool," quoth she. "And I will
say as I ha' got the full o' my bargain,"
quoth she.</p>

<p>Whereat so wroth was I that I said
naught, knowing that if I did open my lips<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
or move my hand 'twould be to curse her
with th' one and cuff her with t'other.</p>

<p>By-and-by saith she, "And where, by'r
lay'kin, wilt thou find a man good enough
in thy eyes for th' lass?" saith she.</p>

<p>"Not on earth," quoth I. "Neither in
this land nor that other across the sea,"
quoth I.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay," quoth she. "Very like thou
wouldst have th' wench to wed with an
angel," quoth she; "to have all thy grandchildren
roosting on a gold bar, and their
dad a-teaching of 'em how to use their
wings," quoth she. "Or with one o' th'
red men i' th' new country, to have them
piebald red and white, like a cock-horse at
Banbury Cross," quoth she. And with
that up she gets, and flings the apple-parings
into th' fire, and gets her to bed
without more ado. Whereupon day doth
again find me i' this very tavern.</p>

<p>Well, well, a year had passed, and things
were jogging very peaceful like, and Keren<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
settled down as quiet as a plough-broken
mare, when one day as I sit i' th' kitchen,
while th' lass mends my apron, there comes
a fumbling at th' latch like as though a
child made shift to open it. Then quoth
I, "Belike 'tis little Marjory Pebble, or one
o' the Mouldy lads over th' way;" for the
babes all loved Keren, and, now that she
was waxed so quiet, th' lads left her more
to herself, and she would sit on th' bench
by the cottage door and make little kickshaws
by th' hour&mdash;elder-wood whistles,
and dolls o' forked radishes, and what not.
So quoth I, "Belike 'tis little Marjory Pebble,"
quoth I, and th' lass having her lap
full o' my apron, I went and opened th'
door. And there, comrade, a-kneeling in
th' grass outside, with her head all hid in
her kirtle, as she had kneeled two years
agone on t'other side o' that very door,
was Mistress Ruth Hacket; and she was
a-sobbing as though her heart would break.
And while I stand staring, ere I could find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
a word to my tongue, comes that lass o'
mine and pushes me aside like as though
I had been little Marjory Pebble&mdash;ha! ha!
And down goes she on her knees beside
th' lass, and gets an arm about her, and
presses down her head, all hid as 'tis in
her kirtle, against her breast, and she saith
to her,</p>

<p>"What troubles thee? Tell Keren, honey.
So so! What troubles thee? Tell
Keren."</p>

<p>And from beneath her kirtle th' poor
jade sobs out, "He's gone! he's gone! he's
gone! They've taken him to work on th'
big seas&mdash;and our child not yet born&mdash;and
me so ailing; and, oh! I want to die! I
want to die!"</p>

<p>Then saith that lass o' mine, saith she,
"Father, do thou fetch some o' th' birch
wine out o' th' cupboard and bring it to me
in a cup;" and to the girl she saith, "Come,
then; come, then," like as though she had
been coaxing some little spring lambkin to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
follow her unto its dam; and she half pulls
and half carries th' wench into th' house,
and seats her on a low stool i' th' chimney-corner,
and kneels down aside of her. And
when I be come with th' drink, she takes
the cup out o' my hand, and makes th'
wench drink 't, holding it to her lips with
one hand, while with the other she cossets
her hair and cheek. And, by-and-by, seeing
myself forgotten, I do withdraw into
the room beyond, and wait till I be called,
that th' lasses may have 't out together.</p>

<p>Now, Ruth's folks were aye so poor that
scarce could they keep clothes on their
backs and food i' their bellies; and it hath
some time occurred to me how that the
Lord might 'a' given such as could not
provide for themselves a coat o' wool or
o' hair that would 'a' covered their bodies,
after the manner of a sheep or goat&mdash;the
righteous being clad i' th' first fashion, and
the wicked after th' last.</p>

<p>Well, well, I must on. I see thou art<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
waxing restless, comrade. Not so? Well,
drink, drink, then, that I may feel thou art
well occupied while that my old tongue
wags.</p>

<p>So poor, then, were Ruth's folks that I
said to myself, said I, "What i' th' name
o' pity," so saith I&mdash;"what i' th' name o'
pity is to become o' the poor lass?" But I
had scarce asked myself th' question when
my lass answers it for me.</p>

<p>"Father," saith she, a-coming and standing
afore me, with the empty cup turning
on her long fingers&mdash;"father," saith she,
keeping those gold-colored eyes o' hers on
mine (methinks they were coined o' th'
same wedge as her heart o' gold)&mdash;"father,"
saith she, just so, "considering all
things," saith she, "I'm going to keep th'
lass in my room till her child be born," so
saith she.</p>

<p>Then saith I, pulling her down into my
arms, "Lass," saith I, "verily do I believe
that not only is every hair o' thy sweet head<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
numbered, but that each one is blessed with
a separate blessing!" And what with my
love for her, and my admiring of her goodness,
and my pride in her, and what with
her pity for the poor girl in th' other room,
we did shed enough tears between us to
ha' o'erflowed th' empty cup in her hands.</p>

<p>So she held me about th' neck with both
arms, and like to ha' run me mad with kissing
th' back o' my neck (for I was e'er one
o' your ticklish sort). I stood it bravely,
however, seeing how she loved me, and
kissed her too whensoever I could get
a chance for th' tightness o' her hugging.
And so we settled it. But Mistress Lemon
was yet to be consulted.</p>

<p>Ready enough was I to shift that job on
my lass's broad shoulders (seeing as how a
reputation for courage with his wife is ne'er
believed o' a man, at any rate, and as how
th' wench had a way o' managing her mother
which sure none could 'a' had that were
not of her own flesh). And that night,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
when her mother was returned from a
round o' gossiping, th' lass tells her all
(having i' th' mean time put Ruth to bed
atween her own sheets). Well, ne'er saw I
my wife in such a rage.</p>

<p>"What!" saith she, "thou hast ta'en it
on thyself to offer my bread and meat to a
good-for-naught hussy as ne'er had a civil
word for any o' us! Thou hast given her
bed-room under my roof without so much
as 'by your leave!' Thou godless hussy,
thou! Where be th' jade? I say, where
be she? Where be she?"</p>

<p>"Where thou shalt not come at her in
thy present humor, mother," saith the lass,
standing with one arm reached out across
the door-way, like as though in verity she
had been the mother and her dam a naughty
child.</p>

<p>"How? Dost word me? dost word me?"
saith my wife. "How? dost take any stray
cat to kitten in my house an' then word me
too?"&mdash;so saith she.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>Then saith th' lass, "Well can I understand,"
saith she, "how, if thou canst speak
i' this fashion o' thy sister's child, thou canst
also speak to thy own as sure no mother
e'er spoke ere this." Then, changing all
suddenly her tone, and dropping down her
arm from the door, "Go an thou like," saith
she, "to abuse the poor creature who hath
come to ask thy help in time o' trouble;
but just so surely as thou dost turn her out
o' door to lie i' th' straw like any common
callet, just so sure do I follow her, to fare
as she fares, and all the village shall know
what thou hast done."</p>

<p>Then for some minutes did they twain
stand and gaze upon one another, and at
last down flumps my wife into a chair, as
though she would break it in pieces for
very rage; but being waxed sulky, and her
own wrath cowed, as 'twere, by her daughter's
more righteous wrath, she saith nothing
more of 't, good or bad.</p>

<p>In three weeks' time th' child is born,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
and as sound and as pretty a babe as e'er
I clapt eyes on, and Keren a-dangling of
him as natural as though she herself had
been a mother, time and again.</p>

<p>"What say'st thou now, lass?" quoth
she. "Wilt trust Keren after this?"</p>

<p>"Is he sound, verily?" saith the poor
little dame, looking shyly upon him.</p>

<p>"Never a spot so big as the splash on
a guinea-flower!" saith Keren. "And ears
like sea-shells."</p>

<p>So, after a-kissing of them both, and th'
top o' th' babe's head (as 'twas permitted
me to do), I steals out and leaves them together.</p>

<p>Well, ne'er saw thou a child grow as did
that child. Meseemed he sprouted like
corn after a rain; and in five months a
was waxed so strong a could stand on 's
feet a-holding to his mother's kirtle. But,
strange to say or not, as thou wilt have 't,
he did seem to love Keren more than he
did th' mother that bore him, a-crying for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
her did she but so much as turn her back,
and not sleeping unless that she would
croon his lullabies to him. Mayhap it was
because her strong arms and round bosom
made a more cosey nest for him than did
th' breast and arms o' his little dam; but
so was 't, and nearly all o' her time did th'
lass give to him. Neither did it seem to
rouse aught o' jealousy in Ruth's heart:
she was too busy a-looking for th' return
o' 's father to bother her pretty pate o'ermuch
concerning him. And she would sit
and talk o' Robin, and o' Robin's goodness,
and o' Robin's sweet ways and words
and doings, until I thought sometimes my
poor lass's heart would just break within
her, if 't had not been broken already these
two years. And one day, as she kneels
beside th' cradle&mdash;Ruth having gone to
see her folks for th' day&mdash;I come in unknown
to her, and stand to watch th' pretty
sight. There kneels she, and Ruth's
red shawl o'er her head to please th' child<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
(Keren ne'er had any bright colors o' her
own those days)&mdash;there kneels she, I say,
beside the cradle, and kittles him with her
nimble fingers, and digs him i' th' ribs after
a fashion that would sure 'a' run me
crazy (though it hath ne'er yet been proven
what a young babe cannot endure at the
hands o' women), and punches and pokes
and worries him, for all th' world like a
kitten worrying a flower. And he, lying
on his back, kicks with both feet at her
face, and winds all his hands in her long
hair, and laughs, and bubbles, and makes
merry, after the fashion o' a spring stream
among many stones. And by-and-by a
change falls o'er her, and she waxes very
solemn, and sits down on th' floor by th'
edge o' th' cradle, with one arm upon 't
and her head on her hand, and she looks
at the babe. In vain doth he clutch at her
hair and at her kerchief, and reach, with
pretty broken murmurings, as of water
through crowding roots, after his little bare<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
toes: never so much as a motion makes
she towards him. But at last up gets she
to her knees, and takes him fiercely into
her strong hands, and holds him off at
arm's-length, looking at him; and she saith
in a deep voice (such as I had not heard
her use for two years), saith she, "For that
thou art not mine," saith she, "I hate thee;
but&mdash;" and here came a change o'er all her
face and voice and manner, like as when
April doth suddenly wake in the midst o'
a wintry day in springtide&mdash;"but," saith
she, "for that thou art his, I love thee!"
And she took him to her bosom, and bowed
down her head over him so that he was
hidden all in her long hair; but the bright
shawl covered it, so that, what with her
stooping and the hiding of her tresses,
a body coming in suddenly at the door
might 'a' easily mistaken her for Ruth.</p>

<p>It was thus with th' man who at that
moment strode past me and caught up
child and woman into his embrace. "I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
have come back to thee," he said&mdash;"I have
come back to thee. Look up, wife! Ruth,
look up!" But when she did look up, and
he saw her face as white as morning, and
her hair as black as night, and her tall
figure like to a young elm-tree&mdash;ay, when
she looked up, ne'er saw I a man not dead
seem so like death. He drops down his
arms from about them, as though smitten
from behind by a sword, and he staggers
and leans against th' table, and lets fall his
head upon his breast, staring straight in
front o' him. But she stands looking upon
him. And I got me out with all speed;
so ne'er knew I more o' what passed between
'em, saving that he did take away
Ruth with him th' next day, and she as
happy as a bird whose mate hath come
back to 't with the springtide. But a knew
how that my lass had taken his wife into
her bed, and nursed her through her sickness
night and day, after the hard words
he had spoken unto her and the ill names<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
he had called her. And that was all I
cared to know. He had set th' iron in
my lass's heart, and now 'twas in his own;
and for th' rust, it did but hurt him more.
Ay, ay, comrade, thou knowest what I do
mean.</p>

<p>Well, the winter passed, and spring
came on again, and 'twas in the May o'
that year that I did break my hammer-arm.
God above us only knows what would 'a'
befallen us had 't not been for my Keren.
Wilt believe 't? (but then I think thou'lt
believe a'most anything o' that lass o' mine
now&mdash;eh, comrade?)&mdash;th' lass did set to
work, and in two weeks' time a was as
good a farrier as was e'er her daddy afore
her. Bodykins, man! thou shouldst 'a'
seen her at it: clad from throat to feet
she was in a leathern apron, looking as like
mine own as though th' mare's skin whereof
mine was fashioned had, as 'twere, foaled
a smaller one for th' lass&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;and
her sleeves rolled up from her brown arms,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
and th' cords a-standing out on them like
th' veins in a horse's shoulder. And so
would she stand, and work th' bellows at
th' forge, until, what with th' red light from
the fire on her face, and on her hair, and
on her bare arms, I was minded o' th'
angel that walked i' the fiery furnace with
th' men in holy writ. And when a pounded
away at a shoe, and her young arm
going like a flail&mdash;chink, chank&mdash;chink,
chank&mdash;and th' white spatters o' hot iron
flying this way and that from th' anvil, meseemed
'twas as though Dame Venus (for
thou knowest how in th' masque twelve
year gone this Yuletide 'twas shown as
how a great dame called Venus did wed
wi' a farrier called Vulcan&mdash;I wot thou
rememberest?)&mdash;as though Dame Venus
had taken away her hammer from her
goodman Vulcan to do 's work for him.
By my troth, 'twas a sight to make a picture
of&mdash;that 'twas, comrade.</p>

<p>Well, ne'er saw I such trouble as that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
arm gave me (and 't has ne'er been strong
since). First 'twould not knit, and then
when 't did 'twas all wrong, and had to be
broken and set o'er again. But th' lass
ne'er gave out once. Late and early, fair
weather or foul, a was at th' forge; and a
came to be known for as good a smith as
there was in all Warwickshire. But, for
that none had e'er heard tell o' a woman
at such work, or for some other reason,
they did come to call her, moreover, "The
Farrier Lass o' Piping Pebworth."</p>

<p>One day, as we sat i' th' door o' th' shop,
a-resting, and talking together&mdash;after a
way we had with us even when she was a
little lass&mdash;there rides up a young gallant,
all dressed out in velvet and galloon, and
a feather in 's hat, and long curls hanging
about his shoulders. Oh ay, a was bonny
enough to look upon. So a draws rein
at th' door. And saith he,</p>

<p>"Art thou th' Farrier Lass o' Piping
Pebworth?" saith he.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Saith she, arising to her feet, and standing
with crossed arms like any man&mdash;saith she,</p>

<p>"Folks call me so," saith she. "But my
name is Keren Lemon."</p>

<p>"A sour name for so sweet a lass," saith
th' gallant.</p>

<p>"Would thou hadst sweetened that old
jest with some new wit!" quoth she.</p>

<p>"Thou art sharp o' tongue," saith he.</p>

<p>"I shoe horses with my arms, not with
my tongue," saith she.</p>

<p>"As I live, a witty jade!" quoth he.
"Thou dost much amuse me, maiden."</p>

<p>"My wit was not fashioned any more
for thy amusement than for the shoeing o'
thy horse," quoth she. "So, if thou dost
not purpose to have him shod, ride on!"
saith she.</p>

<p>Then saith he, to himself, as 'twere,
"Verily," saith he, "they should call thee
the <i>harrier</i> lass, for thou hast run down
and found my manners when that old
hounds have failed." And to her he saith,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
"I do purpose to have my horse shod,
maiden; and I cry thee pardon for having
given thee offence."</p>

<p>"It is easier to give offence than pardon,"
saith she. "Howbeit, thou art pardoned.
Say no more." Whereupon she
sets to work and, taking th' horse's foot
atween her knees, falls to filing his hoof
in such wise that I could not 'a' done better
in her place, though the Queen should
ask me to sup afterwards at St. James's.
But the stranger could not hold his
tongue; and when he saw her working th'
bellows, and a-making of th' shoe, and th'
way she swung th' great hammer, "By my
troth," saith he, "I would I could paint
thee as Sally Mander to give to th' Queen,"
saith he.</p>

<p>Then saith my lass, "I know not of any
wench called Sally Mander," saith she, a-burning
of th' horse's hoof with th' hot
shoe; "but if she consorts familiarly with
such as be above her," so saith she, "methinks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
'tis as well for both o' us that I
know her not," saith she&mdash;every word o't
just as I tell thee.</p>

<p>Then saith the gallant, clapping hand
to thigh, so that it made such a sound as
when a young child is trounced, "By my
troth," saith he, "an thy brows be not
worthy o' a coronet, ne'er saw I any that
merited to wear one. What wouldst thou
if thou wert a lady, lass?"</p>

<p>She saith, a-rolling up of her sleeves a
little tighter, and looking up at him as he
sate again upon his horse, "Meanest thou
if I were the wife o' a lord?" saith she.</p>

<p>"Even so," saith he, laughing. "Verily
thou hast come at my meaning with a commendable
quickness. Well, and if thou
wert the wife o' a lord, what wouldst thou
do?"</p>

<p>Then saith she, speaking very slowly,
and crossing of her arms again upon her
breast&mdash;saith she,</p>

<p>"I would bring up such sons as were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
born to me to behave worthily o' their
station in life, and not to forget their manhood
by speaking with insolence unto such
honest maids as had never offered them
affront." Whereupon she did up with her
kit o' tools, and pass by me into th' forge;
and th' man rode on with a reddened
visage.</p>

<p>But it befell only two days later that a
came again to th' forge, his horse having
cast another shoe.</p>

<p>And again th' lass sets all to right for
him, he keeping a civil tongue in 's head
this time; and o' that we thought naught
one way or th' other. But when a comes
a third time, and yet a fourth and a fifth
and a sixth, "Father," saith th' lass&mdash;"father,"
saith she, "this must be stopt," saith
she.</p>

<p>"Ay, verily," saith I. "But how wilt do
't?" saith I.</p>

<p>"I'll do 't, never fear," saith she.</p>

<p>And a did, comrade. Ha! ha! I'd trust<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
that wench to make Satan keep to heel
like any well-broke puppy. 'Twas in this
way. The next time th' gallant comes riding
up (that being th' seventh time in all,
ye mind)&mdash;well, the next time up comes
riding he, and he saith to her, saith he, "I
have come to ask thy service yet again,
damsel," saith he; "but Merrylegs hath
cast another shoe."</p>

<p>Then saith th' lass&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;every
word as I tell thee, comrade&mdash;saith she,
"Methinks, my lord, if my work hold no
better than that&mdash;methinks," saith she,
"'twere as well thou went for th' shoeing o'
thy horse to Timothy Makeshift, as lives
in Marigold Lane," saith she. "For if it
come to th' ears o' others how that I will
shoe a horse one day, and th' next how that
he will cast th' shoe&mdash;if it so be known,"
saith she, "no more custom will I get to
keep my father and mother in their old
age."</p>

<p>Then doth he leap down from his horse,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
and he doffs his hat as though my lass had
been any fine lady; and quoth he,</p>

<p>"Well and justly hast thou spoken; and
I do stand confessed of my fault. But,
maiden, thou wast not born unto th' life
thou leadest; and here in thy presence I
do ask thy father to bestow upon me thy
hand. I am Sir Dagonet Balfour, of Balfour
Hall; and if thou art willing I will
make thee my lady."</p>

<p>Now, I was struck dumb as though my
tongue had jumped forth o' my mouth, and
never a blessed thing could I do saving
stare, comrade. But that lass o' mine&mdash;that
lass o' mine, comrade&mdash;she stands and
looks at him, and never so much as a glint
o' red in her face. And saith she, "My
lord," saith she, "if that thou meanest what
thou hast said, thou hast forgotten thine
estate and not remembered mine. Since
God hath not made me a lady, methinks it
is not in the power o' one o' His creatures
so to do. But I do thank thee for seeking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
to honor me, and wish thee joy when
thou shalt take in wedlock some highborn
maiden."</p>

<p>Then saith he, "An I wed not thee, ne'er
will I be wed. What! dost thou think I
can look on in patience and see a woman
such as thou following the trade of a farrier?"</p>

<p>Then saith she, "If Jesus Christ followed
th' trade o' a carpenter," saith she,
"sure," saith she, "Keren Lemon can follow
th' trade o' a farrier," saith she&mdash;every
blessed word as I tell thee, comrade. And
no more would she have to do with him,
but got her into th' forge and left him
standing there.</p>

<p>Well, thou might 'a' thought that was th'
end o't. Not a bit&mdash;not a bit, comrade.
Th' knight would be a-riding up at all
times and in all weather, and somehow 't
gets out i' th' village (though not through
my lass, I warrant ye) as how he doth in
verity seek to espouse my Keren. Well,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
o' all th' tirrits and to-do's as e'er you heard
on!</p>

<p>Methought when Mistress Lemon found
out that th' girl had refused th' gallant's
offer th' house would be a tighter fit for us
three than its shell for an unhatched chick.
'Twas worry, worry, worry, from morn till
night, and from night till morn it was worry,
worry, worry, till I scarce knew whether
'twould be better to murder my wife and
hang for 't, or leave her alone and live with
her.</p>

<p>"Th' hussy!" quoth she&mdash;"th' ungrateful
hussy! a ought to be tossed in a blanket,"
quoth she, "and thou along with her,
thou jack-pudding, thou ravelling!" quoth
she.</p>

<p>"If I be a jack-pudding," saith I, "I ha'
more descendants than most such," saith I.</p>

<p>"Yea," quoth she, "verily," quoth she;
"and all nine o' th' lads be jacks," saith she,
"and th' wench as very a pudding as e'er
fell to pieces for want o' being held together,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
saith she. "Out on ye both! I'm
done with ye!"</p>

<p>"For that, God be praised!" saith I, and
left ere she could answer.</p>

<p>But one day as I sate i' th' kitchen, a-cosseting
o' my lame arm as though 't had
been a babe, I hear a sound o' wheels and
a clatter o' horses' hoofs; and, lo! there be
a chariot pulled up afore the door, with
four gray horses a-making play with their
trappings, and a coachman, all wig and
gilding, a-sitting on th' box. And ere a
could move, out steps a fine dame, with her
hair all in hillocks, as 'twere, and a paling
o' lace round about her head, like as 't had
been a flower-garden, and a farthingale to
'a' covered th' big malt-pot with as little
to-do as a hen covers an egg. And up
comes she to th' door, and her tire-woman
a-holding of her robes, and two footmen
going before, and in she comes&mdash;like as
though Riches and Death had a' th' same
right to enter a poor man's house without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
knocking. And saith she to me, saith she,
a-filling up o' the room with her finery, like
a cuckoo ruffling out its feathers in another
bird's nest, saith she,</p>

<p>"Be this th' cottage o' Humfrey Lemon
th' farrier?" saith she.</p>

<p>"It be so; and I be he," saith I.</p>

<p>"And be thou th' father o' th' wench
they call th' Farrier Lass o' Piping Pebworth?"
saith she.</p>

<p>"I be, an' proud o't," say I, a-beginning
to think that she might 'a' knocked at th'
door, for all her greatness.</p>

<p>"Where's th' lass?" saith she, as she
might 'a' said "Where's my glove?"</p>

<p>Then saith I, "Madam," saith I, "most
like she's gone about her business," saith I.</p>

<p>"My good man," saith she, after a fashion
that did cause me to feel aught but
good&mdash;"my good man," saith she, "dost
thou know to whom thou speakest?"</p>

<p>"Verily," saith I, "thou art ahead o' me
there, madam."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>"Boor," saith she, "I am the Lady o'
Balfour Hall."</p>

<p>"An' so could my lass 'a' been, had she
willed it," saith I; but ere I could further
forget myself, in comes Keren by another
door, and she saith,</p>

<p>"Father, do thou go out, and leave me
to speak with this lady." Then to th'
dame she saith, "Your ladyship," saith she,
"I am Keren Lemon, that be called th'
Farrier Lass. What wouldst thou with
me?"</p>

<p>Then I got me out o' th' room, but not
out o' hearing distance; and this is what
followed:</p>

<p>"I have heard," saith th' dame, "these
reports concerning my son Sir Dagonet
and thee, and, to my sorrow, I find upon
inquiry," saith she, "that they be true.
Moreover, though it doth shame me to
the dust to confess it, I have had an interview
with my son Sir Dagonet," so saith
she&mdash;every word o't as I tell thee&mdash;"and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
he is determined in his purpose o' ruining
his life and th' happiness o' his mother.
Therefore I have come to thee, to ask
that thou persistest in the course which
thou hast begun," saith she. "And here,"
saith she, "is gold to hold thy tongue concerning
my visit unto thee." And therewith
she did count down ten broad gold
pieces upon th' kitchen table. "I must
also ask thee," then continued she, ere my
lass could answer her, "to allow me to remain
under thy roof until my carriage be
returned from th' other end o' the village,
where it hath been sent with my tire-woman
to purchase some ribbon to tie my
parrot to 's perch."</p>

<p>Never a word saith my lass, but she goes
to th' door and opens it, and lifting up her
voice, she halloos to a little ragged urchin
who is at some spot on th' other side o' th'
street; and he being come as fast as his
little shanks would bring him, she bids him
enter, and taking him up in her arms, she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
lifts him up so that a can reach th' gold
on th' table, and saith she,</p>

<p>"Thou'rt not o'er-clean to touch, my
good little mouse," saith she, "but thou'rt
cleaner than that stuff thou seest. There,
lad, that's for thee, if an thou'lt run to th'
other end o' th' village and bid them return
at once with my lady Balfour's carriage,"
so saith she. Then, th' lad having stuffed
all 's doublet with th' gold, she sets him
on 's feet, and off a scuttles on th' best-paid
errand e'er chanced since th' world
began. And my lass, having courtesied to
the thunder-stricken dame, gets her outside
(where I go nigh to smothering her with
kisses), and leaves her ladyship in possession
o' th' kitchen.</p>

<p>Well, comrade, right sure am I that
thou dost think that was the end on
't. Not a bit. Sir Dagonet did himself
come to th' cottage th' very next day to
see th' lass, and they had many words
together, and at last he did accuse her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
o' false pride and proud humility. And
saith he,</p>

<p>"Wouldst thou make misery for the man
who loves thee best of all the world, merely
to satisfy a notion o' thine own? Greatness
and goodness," saith he, "dwell in the
heads and hearts o' mankind, not in their
birth or purses. I do ask thee, with all
respect, to be my wife, and I am prepared
to face th' anger o' my mother and o' th'
Queen. Ay," saith he, his face gone red
as a girl's, and comes nigh to her&mdash;"ay,
maiden," saith he, "I am even ready to
seek th' new country with thee as my wife,
and to leave title and lands and Queen and
mother behind me."</p>

<p>Then saith she&mdash;and I had not seen
tears in her eyes for many a day&mdash;</p>

<p>"My lord," saith she, "well and nobly
hast thou spoken, and with all my soul
do I honor thee for it, and I thank thee
with all my heart and soul. But, my lord,
even were there not thy rank and position<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
atween us, there is atween us," saith she,
"which would hold us as far apart as the
sea doth hold this England which we live
in and th' new country o' which thou didst
speak. For," saith she&mdash;and she speaks
in a steady voice, howbeit 'tis very low,
and she keeps her sun-like eyes on his&mdash;"for,
my lord," saith she, "all the love that
was mine to give hath been another man's
these many years."</p>

<p>Then saith he never another word, but
bends his knee and kisses her long brown
hand as though 't had been th' Queen's;
and he gets him from th' cottage.</p>

<p>Now, two more years were sped since
that Ruth had left us, and sometimes
would we hear through friends o' th' little
lad and 's mother and father, and always
was Ruth a-sending of pretty messages to
Keren&mdash;her love, and her thanks, and how
happy she was, and th' boy so like his father&mdash;and
more than I remember.</p>

<p>A full year had th' lass been at work in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
my shop, and my arm no more fit to hammer
than afore. So I looks about to get
a lad to help her in her work, seeing as
'twere too much for one wench. And,
Lord! th' trouble I had! Ten lads did I
try, one right after th' other; and one
would be saucy, and another dull, and another
would take 't into his pumpkin head
to fall in love wi' th' lass; and all o' 'em
lazy. But, God-a-mercy! how's a man to
tell a lazy lad till he ha' tried him?&mdash;unless
it be old Butter. Ha! ha! I ha' just
minded me o' th' way he used to treat th'
lads that came to Amhurste to hire for under-gardeners.
He would stand with 's
owlish old visage a-set on 's hoe-handle, for
all th' world like a fantastic head carved
out o' a turnip and set on a stick, and a
would let th' lad go on with 's story o' how
Dame This commended him for that, and
o' how Dame That commended him for
this, and o' how a had worked under my
lord So-and-So's head-gardener and in my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
lady So-and-So's own hot-houses; and
when a had got through, never a word
would old Butter say, but a would just step
round behind th' lad, as solemn as a gravedigger
on a cold day, and a would lift up
th' tail o' 's doublet and look at th' seat o'
's breeches. And if they were fairly worn
a would hire th' lad; but if an they were
much worn a would say, "No work dost
thou get from me, my lad," would a say,
"thou sittest down too often to work for
Anthony Butter"&mdash;so would a say&mdash;every
word o't just as I ha' told thee. Ha! ha!
And all the time as sober as a coroner
inspecting a corse. Ha! ha! ha! Methinks
I can see him now&mdash;th' old zany.</p>

<p>Well, well, a was a good man, was Anthony
Butter; and if a was a bit puffed up
with 's own importance, a's charity ne'er
got in a like condition that it did not bring
forth some kind act.</p>

<p>Well, th' months swung round, and 'twas
nigh to Martlemas in that same year, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
one day as I sat i' th' forge door, a-swearing
roundly to myself concerning my lame
arm, and how that 'twould not mend, up
comes galloping a man, like one distraught,
and a child on th' saddle afore him, and a
flings himself down with th' child in 's
arms (making no shift whate'er to hold
th' horse, which gallops on with th' reins
swinging), and a cries out, a-setting of th'
child on my knee&mdash;a cries out,</p>

<p>"For God's sake, help me! My child
hath been bit by a mad dog! Help me in
some way, for th' love of God!"</p>

<p>And I saw that 'twas Robert Hacket
that crouched and quivered at my knee
like a hurt hound, and th' child as like to
him as one leaf on a tree is to th' other.
But ere I could do or say aught, comes
that lass o' mine, and ups with th' babe in
her arms, and he roaring as lustily as any
bull-calf with th' wound in 's little brown
arm, and she sees where the beast hath
bitten him. Then sets she him down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
again on my lap, and runs and fetches a
bar o' iron and heats it i' th' forge till 'tis
white-hot, and all th' time th' poor father
a-sobbing, and kissing of th' babe, and calling
on me to help him, like as though I
were God Almighty. And while he was
so doing, and the babe like to burst with
weeping, and I gone mad with not knowing
what to be at, comes that wench, comrade,
and jerks up th' babe, and sets th'
white-hot metal in 's soft flesh.</p>

<p>Ay, comrade, a did, and a held it there
till where th' dog's fangs had been was
burned as black as th' anvil. And then,
when 'tis done, and th' babe again upon 's
feet, and we two for praising and blessing
o' her, down drops she all in a heap on th'
floor atween us, like a hawk that hath been
smitten in mid-heaven. Then 'twas, comrade,
that th' babe was left to endure his
pain as best he might; never thought more
did 's father give him that day; but he
runs and lifts th' lass in 's strong arms, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
bears her out into th' fresh air, and he calls
her his "dear," and his "own," and "his life,"
and his "Keren," till, had 't not been for my
lass's coming back to life, I would 'a' struck
him on th' mouth for a-speaking so unto her,
and he th' husband o' another woman.</p>

<p>But no sooner opes she her eyes than he
hath both her hands hid in one o' his, and
close against his breast, and she lying back
in 's arms as though she were any chrisom
child, and her big eyes wide on his, and he
saith to her,</p>

<p>"Lass! lass!" saith he, "I ha' come to
marry thee, an thou wilt have me," quoth
he. "I ha' come to marry thee; and may
God bless thee for saving th' child!"</p>

<p>Then did I understand; but she saith,
with her great eyes not moving&mdash;saith she&mdash;only
one word&mdash;"Ruth?" saith she, even
so, once, low like that&mdash;"Ruth?"</p>

<p>"Ay, lass, I know," he saith unto her. "I
know," he saith. "But all's well with Ruth.
Ruth is in heaven."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>Then saith she, while a light leaps out o'
her tearful eyes, like as when the sun doth
shine suddenly through April rain&mdash;saith
she, as she were breathing her life into th'
words,</p>

<p>"Methinks I be there too."</p>

<p>And also did I understand her, how that
she meant that to be lying in th' arms o'
him she loved, after all those weary years,
was like being in heaven; but he questions
her.</p>

<p>"How, lass?" saith he. "Where dost
thou think thou art? Thou art in thy true
love's arms," saith he.</p>

<p>"Ay, there is heaven," she saith.</p>

<p>And I stole away to get th' babe some
kickshaws i' th' village, that they twain
might be alone together.</p>

<p>Well, well, all that was two year ago,
comrade&mdash;two year ago; and now that lass
o' mine hath a babe o' her own, and as valiant
a rogue as ever bellowed. Thou must
come and sup with us to-night. Na, na, I'll<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
take no refusal&mdash;dost hear? I will not.
And a word o' persuasion i' thy ear, comrade:
Mistress Lemon hath been dead
this twelvemonth, comrade. Ah ha! Wilt
a-come the now? That's well. And thou
shalt hear that lass o' mine troll thee "Jog
on, jog on," and "Mistress mine, where art
thou roaming?" and "Listen, Robin, while
I woo." Come, comrade, come. But stay;
let's crack another drink together ere we
go. Joel! What there! Joel, I say! Another
quart o' sack for Master Turnip!</p>

<h2>NURSE CRUMPET TELLS THE<br />
STORY.</h2>

<div class="hang1"><i>Time.</i>&mdash;A bitter January night in the year of Grace
1669.</div>

<div class="hang1"><i>Scene.</i>&mdash;Sunderidge Castle&mdash;The great hall&mdash;A monstrous
fire burning in the big fireplace&mdash;Nurse
Crumpet discovered seated on a settle&mdash;At her
either knee lean the little Lady Dorothy and her
brother, the young Earl of Sunderidge, Lord Humphrey
Lennox.</div>


<p><i>Nurse Crumpet.</i>&mdash;Nay, now, Lady Dorothy,
why wilt thou be at the pains o' such
a clamoring? Sure thou hast heard that
old tale o'er a hundred times; and thou
too, my lord? Fie, then! Wouldst seek
to flatter thy old nurse with this seeming
eagerness? Go to! I say thou canst not
in truth want to hear me drone o'er that
ancient narrative. Well, then, an I must,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
I must. Soft! Hold my fan betwixt thy
dainty cheeks and the blaze, sweetheart,
lest the fire-fiend witch thy roses into very
poppy flowers. And thou, my lord, come
closer to my side, lest the draught from the
bay-window smite thee that thou howlest o'
th' morrow with a crick i' thy neck. Well,
well, be patient. All in time, in time. Soft,
now! Ye both mind that I was but a little
lass when thy grandmother, the Lady
Elizabeth Lennox, did take me to train as
her maid-in-waiting. I was just turned sixteen
that Martlemas, and not a fair-sized
wench for my years either. Would ye believe?
I could set my two thumbs together
at my backbone in those days, and my
ring-fingers would all but kiss too.</p>

<p><i>Lord Humphrey.</i>&mdash;Ha! ha! Nurse, thy
fingers would be but ill satisfied lovers under
those conditions nowadays. Eh, Dolly?</p>

<p><i>Lady Dorothy.</i>&mdash;Hold thy tongue for an
unmannerly lad, Humphrey. Do not thou
heed him, nurse, but go on with thy story.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Nurse Crumpet.</i>&mdash;For all thy laughter,
my lord, I'd a waist my garter would bind
in those days, and was as light on my toes
as those flames that dance i' th' chimney.
Lord! Lord! how well I mind me o' th'
first time that e'er I clapt eyes on Jock
Crumpet! I was speeding home with a jug
o' water from the spring, and what with his
staring as he stood at the road-side to let
me pass, and what with a root i' th' way, I
all but lost my footing. Yet did I swing
round alone, holding fast my jug, and ne'er
one blessed drop o' water spilled I, for all
my tripping. "By'r lay'kin!" quoth he,
"thou'rt as light on thy feet as a May wind,
and as I live I will dance the Barley Break
with thee this harvesting or I will dance
with none!" And i' faith a was as good
as his word, for by hook or by crook, and
much scheming and planning, and bringing
o' gewgaws to my mother, and a present
o' a fine yearling to my father, that
harvesting did I dance the Barley Break<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
with Jock Crumpet. And a was a feather-man
in a round reel.</p>

<p>Well, 'twas the year o' my meeting with
Jock, thou mindst. (And a cold winter
that was&mdash;Christ save us! There be ne'er
such winters nowadays. This night is as
a summer noon i' th' comparison.) 'Twas
the year o' my first meeting with Jock, and
my lady, your grandmother, sent for me to
the castle, to be her waiting-maid. Lord!
'twas a troublous time! What with joy at
my good fortune, and sorrow at quitting
my mother, I was fain to smile with one
corner o' my mouth and look grievously
with the other, like a zany at a village fair.
And Jock, he would not that I went, for
that he could not see me, or consort wi'
me so often: Jock was aye honey-combed
wi' th' thing ye call "sentiment." A would
grin on a flower I had wov'n in my locks
by th' hour together. And 'tis my belief
a could a spun him a warm doublet out
o' the odds and ends o' ribbon and what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
not he had filched from me when my eyes
were elsewhere. And Jock&mdash;but 'tis neither
here nor there o' Jock. In those days
thy grandmother had only one child, a little
lass, the Lady Patience. And ne'er was
man or maid worse named; for to call such
a flibbertigibbet "Patience" were as though
one should name a frisksome colt "Slumber,"
or christen a spring brook "Quiet."
Patience, quotha! 'Twas patience in truth
a body had need of, who was thrown at all
with her little ladyship. But there was
ne'er so beautiful a maiden born in all the
broad land of England; nor will be again&mdash;not
though London Tower be standing
when the last trump sounds. Meseemed
she was an elf-sprite, so tiny was she; and
her face like a fair flower, so fresh and
pure. Her hair was shed about her face
like sunlight on thistle-down, and her eyes
made a shining behind it, like the big blue
gems in her mother's jewel-box. When
she laughed, it was as water falling into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
water from a short height, with ripples, and
little murmurs, and a clear tinkling sound.
But she was ne'er more at rest than the
leaves on an aspen-tree. Hither and thither
would she flit, this way and that, up and
down, round and round, backward and forward,
about and about. I' faith, ofttimes
would I be right dizzy come nightfall, with
following of her; for ere I had been at the
castle a day, she took so mighty a fancy
to me, that naught would do but she must
have me for her maid; and so my lady,
who (God pardon my boldness!) did utterly
spoil her in all things, gave me unto her
as a nurse-maid.&mdash;But sure ye are a-weary
o' this old tale!</p>

<p><i>Lady Dorothy and Lord Humphrey in a
breath.</i>&mdash;Nay, go on, go on.</p>

<p><i>Nurse Crumpet.</i>&mdash;Well, well, o' all the
story-loving bairns! But I must invent
me a new history for the next time o' telling.</p>

<p><i>Lord Humphrey.</i>&mdash;Nay, that thou shalt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
not. We will ne'er like any as well as we
like this one. So despatch.</p>

<p><i>Nurse Crumpet.</i>&mdash;But my lady had also
an adopted daughter, a niece o' my lord's&mdash;one
Mistress Marian Every&mdash;and she
walked beside the little Lady Patience as
night might walk beside day, for she was
as brown o' skin as a mountain stream, and
her hair like a cloud at even-tide, dark,
but of no certain color, albeit as soft as ravelled
silk, and marvellous hard to comb on
account o' its fineness. Mistress Marian
was full head and shoulders taller than her
cousin, the Lady Patience, and she could
lift her aloft in her arms, and swing her
from side to side, as a supple bough swings
a bird. And her eyes were dark, and cool
to gaze into, like a pool o' clear water o'er
autumn leaves, and sometimes there were
glints o' light in them, like the spikes i' th'
evening-star when thou dost gaze steadily
upon it. Black and white were not more
different than were they, and they resembled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
even less in mind than they did in
body. When Lady Patience waxed wroth,
her cheeks burned like two coals, and thou
couldst hear her little teeth grinding together,
like pebbles squeezed i' th' palm o'
thy hand; but when Mistress Marian was
an-angered, the blood rushed back to her
heart, and she was whiter than a lamb
at the shearing, and her lips like white
threads. Then would the light shoot and
spin in her eyes, and her nostrils suck in
and out, like those of a fretful horse. And
she was fierce after the manner of a man
rather than of a maid. Moreo'er, she was
full a year younger than the Lady Patience;
but she looked it not; rather did
her ladyship look full two years younger
than Mistress Marian. And I loved them
both, and tried as a Christian not to prefer
one before the other; but what with
my lady's stealings of her arms about my
neck as I sat at my stitchery, and popping
of comfits in my pocket when I would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
otherwise engaged, and teasings, and ticklings,
and sundry other pretty witcheries
which I do not at this day recall, I was
fairly cozened into loving her the best.
(Honey, I charge thee hold my fan betwixt
thee and the fire.) But to continue.&mdash;Mistress
Marian was aye courteous and
kindly to me as heart could wish, and
every night did she thank me i' th' prettiest
fashion, when I had combed and unpinned
her for the night; but, Lord! I
had much ado to get Lady Patience combed
or unpinned at all! First would she
jump with both knees upon mine, and hug
my very breath away; then, when I had
at last coaxed her to get down, first she
would perch on one leg and then o' the
other, and then be a-twisting her head now
over this shoulder, now over that, to see
how I came on with the unpinning, that
it was with a prayer to God that I finally
set her night-gown over her shoulders,
and led her to bed. As for her prayers&mdash;Jesu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
aid me and pardon her!&mdash;'twas a
matter of hours to get her to say "Our
Father" straight through, what with her
vowing that she wished not bread every
day, and how that if his lordship her father
forgave not trespassers (for I could ne'er
draw the difference between trespass<i>es</i> and
trespass<i>ers</i> into her pretty pate), neither
would she; and how she did not believe
God would lead her into temptation at any
time, but that it was the Devil; and how
it must anger God even to think of such
doings on His part&mdash;what, I say, with all
this, methought sometimes it would be cock-crow
ere I got her safely to sleep. And
all this time Mistress Marian would be lying
as quiet as any mouse, with her big plait of
hair between her fingers, for so she always
slept, with her hair fast in her hands, as
though she loved its beauty; and in truth it
was the one great beauty she had, for my
little lady put her out with her glitter as the
sunlight doth extinguish a morning moon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>Now I had been at the castle scarce
two months when one day it chances that
I hear my lady a-telling o' my lord how
as her brother, Lord Charles Radnor, dying
wifeless, had left his only son to her
care until he should come of age. And
on that Tuesday the little lord set foot
in the castle; and my lady was down at
the door-way to meet him, in a new velvet
gown, with her wimple sewn in fine
pearls, and my lord with her; but my two
nurslings waxed shy at the last minute, and
would not come down, but leaned and peered
through the posts o' the stair-rail, and
my little lady let fall one o' her shoes in
her eagerness to glimpse at her new cousin.
And straightway ran the lad and lifted
the wee shoe, and looked upward, laughing,
and my lord and lady having retired
into the dining-hall, to see that some cold
viands were in readiness (it being then near
to nightfall, though not yet supper hour).&mdash;"Ho!
thou little cinder witch," cried he;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
"I am the prince that has found thy shoe,
and when I shall have found thee, if that
thy temper be as small as thy shoe, fear
not but that I will kiss thee too!" With
that, he ran up the stair-way, two and three
steps at a leap.</p>

<p>And I followed, for I knew not what
would happen an he claimed his kiss as
he had threatened (knowing as did I, that
in verity my lady's shoe would a been a
tight fit for her temper).</p>

<p>But when he was arrived at the top, lo!
they had both fled, neither had they left
so much as a ribbon behind them. Then
the lad laughed again, as pleasant a laugh
as e'er I heard in all my days, and quoth
he, "I would be but a poor prince an I
had not to search for my little princess."
So off he starts, and I after him, up and
down corridors, in at half-open doors, out
upon balconies, hither and thither, after the
manner o' my little lady on her most unquiet
days, till at last, for the sake o' peace,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
I did slyly lead him in the direction o' the
great nursery. There, catching sight o' a
little red petticoat, he enters, where stand
my truant elves confessed, Mistress Marian
frowning and biting o' her dark hair, but
my little lady like to stifle, with both hands
over her mouth to hide her smiles, and her
blue eyes dancing a very Barley Break o'
mirth among the yellow sheaves o' her
tresses.</p>

<p>Then there was much parley o'er the
fitting o' the shoe, as both damsels did
straightway sit down upon their feet, neither
for a long time would they move an
eyelash, till his lordship, with a twink o' his
eye at me, did suggest corns and bunions
as a reason for their 'havior&mdash;and, Lord!
then 'twas pretty to mark how like little
chicks beneath their dam's feathers, first
one little foot and then the other did steal
out from the rich lace o' their petticoats.
And ere one could cry "Oh!" for a pinch,
he had slipt the shoe on my little lady's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
wee foot, and had kissed her right heartily.
Moreo'er, what I did most marvel at, was
that she neither cuffed nor sought to cuff
him, but dropt down her head until her hair
made a veil before her face, and moved that
foot whereon he had set her shoe, gently
back and forth as though the leather was
stiff to her ankle, and I saw that she looked
at it from under her heavy hair. But
Mistress Marian still held aloof, and chewed
upon her dark locks like a heifer on its cud.
And her eyes were every whit as dark and
solemn as a very cow's. Then the young
lord laughed again, and cried out, "Ha! the
ox-eyed June!" or some such apery, and
went and kneeled before her in mock fashion,
as before a queen, and quoth he, "Fair
goddess" (for 'twas afterwards explained to
me what manner of being was a goddess,
namely, some kind of a foreign fairy)&mdash;"Fair
goddess," quoth he, "show me how I
may dispel thy wrath." And still she scowled
on him, but spoke no word. And he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
continued, and said, "I prithee, fair lady,
cast but one smile upon thy humble knight"
(thou mind'st their pretty foolery has stuck
i' my old pate unto this day).</p>

<p>Then she answered and saith, "Thou silly
lad, how can I be a goddess and a lady both
in one? Thou hast not even enough wit to
make a good fool. So!" (for Mistress Marian
had a sharp tongue at times).</p>

<p>But he was not so much as ruffled, and
laughed even again, most heartily. And he
said, "I do perceive that thou art not fashioned
either as goddess or lady, therefore
be my comrade, and we will fight together
for the weal o' yon fairy princess." All at
once she laughed too, and yielded him her
hand, and said, "I like thee. What is thy
name?"</p>

<p>He said, "My name is Ernle; and I like
thee too; therefore, I pray thee, tell me
thine."</p>

<p>So she told him, and my little lady sidling
up, the three fell presently a-chattering like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
linnets at sunrise, and from that hour on I
had no trouble with them.</p>

<p>'Twas pretty to mark them at their fantasies.
They were aye out-o'-door save
when 'twas rainy weather, and then methought
the castle had scarce room enough
for them. In all their games Mistress Marian
was the little lord's comrade, and wore
a helmet o' silvered wood, and carried a
wooden sword silvered to match her head-gear,
and the little lord was likewise apparelled.
And he called her ever "Comrade,"
and clapped her o' th' shoulder, as mankind
will clap one the other when conversing.</p>

<p>But my little lady, they both agreed, was
a fairy princess; and, Lord, Lord! 'twould
take me from now 'til Martlemas next to
name the perilous 'scapes that did befall her.
They fished her out of moats, they bore her
from blazing castles, they did drag her from
the maws o' dragons and other wild beasts
I know not how to name. Thrice was the
little Lord of Radnor in dire straits at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
claws o' goblin creatures. Three times did
his comrade rescue him by thwacking upon
the chair which did represent the dreadful
beast, till I was in sore dread there would
be no mending of it, and me, mayhap, dismissed
from the castle for carelessness.
And always when 'twas all o'er, and the little
princess in safety, I was called upon to
act parson and wed my little lady to the little
lord, while Mistress Marian leaned on
her sword to witness the doings.</p>

<p>One day, in their rovings through the
park, they came by chance upon a door in
the hill-side, but so o'ergrown with creeping
vines that, had not the little lord stumbled
upon it, 'twas very like it had been there to
this day without discovery. Well, no sooner
do they see the door than they must
needs open it, spite o' all my scolding, and
peer within. 'Twas but a darksome hole,
after all&mdash;a kind o' cave i' th' hill-side, which
they did afterwards find out from thy grandfather
was used in days gone by for concealing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
treasures in time of war. And indeed
it seemed a safe place, for there were
two rusty bolts as big as my arm, one o' th'
inside and one o' th' outside, and the creeping
things hid all. As thou mightst think,
it grew to be their favorite coigne for playing
their dragon and princess trickeries. I
would sit with my stitchery on a fallen log
in the sunshine, while they ran in and out
o' th' grewsome hole. But in all their frolicking
my little lady could ne'er abide the
sight o' their swords, and she pleaded ever
for gentler games. One day (I shall ne'er
forget, though I live to see doomsday) they
did crown her a queen, and then my lord
would have it that she dubbed him her
knight. She pleaded that prettily against
it methought the veriest boor in Christendom
would a given in to her, but my little
lord was stanch. So they made her a
throne o' flowers, and when she was seated
thereon, Mistress Marian handed her the
great wooden sword, and my lord, kneeling,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
bade her strike him on the shoulder with
the flat side o' th' sword, saying, "Rise, Sir
Ernle, my knight for evermore!"</p>

<p>She got out the words as he bade her,
but when 't came to the stroke, what with
her natural fright, and what with the sunlight
on the silver, she brought down the
heavy blade edgewise on the boy's pate, laying
wide quite a gash above his left eyebrow,
so that the blood trickled down his
cheek. When she saw that, meseemed all
the blood in her body went to keep his company,
for she turned whiter than her smock,
and ran and got her arm about him and
saith, o'er and o'er again, "Ernle! Ernle!
I have killed thee!"</p>

<p>He laughed, to comfort her, and made
light of it, and wetting his finger in the
blood, drew a cross on his brow and said,
"Nay, thou hast not killed me. And moreo'er,
I am not only thy knight, but thy Red
Cross Knight into the bargain, and thou my
lady forever. See! I will seal thee with my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
very blood!" and ere she could draw back,
he had set also a cross on her white brow.
She shuddered and fell a-weeping, and drew
her hand across her brow to wipe away the
ugly stain; and when she saw that she had
but smeared it on her hand, she trembled
more than ever, and it was not for some
days that I could quiet her.</p>

<p>I do but relate this story, to show in what
horror my little lady did ever hold swords
and bloodshed.</p>

<p>Well, to continue&mdash;</p>

<p>This could not last for aye, and when two
more years were sped, his uncle sent the
little lord to a place o' learning; and afterwards
to travel to and fro upon the earth,
after the manner of Satan in the Book of
Job (God forgive me! but 't has ever seemed
like that to me). And we set not eyes
on him for eight years. Now in that time,
lo! I was married, and my little lady and
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Mistres'">Mistress</ins> Marian in long kirtles, and their
hair looped up upon their heads. Mistress<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Marian was yet full head and shoulders
above my little lady, and her skin as brown
as ever. But my little lady was as bright
and slender as a sun-ray.</p>

<p>They would speak to me sometimes of
Lord Radnor, and how that great folks
were saying great things of him, and how
he was become a soldier and a marvellous
person altogether; but as the years went
by they seemed not so ready to talk o' him,
only sometimes my little lady would pull
down my head as I smoothed the bedclothes
over her at night, and quoth she,
"Nurse, dost think he will be much
changed? My hair hath not darkened
much, hath it? Dost think his curls will
be different from what they were when he
was a lad?" And I would have to tell her
"No" a dozen times ere she would let me
go. But Mistress Marian said never a
word.</p>

<p>One day I learned of my lady how that
Lord Radnor was to return the next week,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
and meseemed in truth the whole castle
was waxed distraught.</p>

<p>It is not in my power to tell o' th' doings,
but suffice it to say, my lord did cozen
them all, and come a full day ere he was
expected.</p>

<p>When he came, Mistress Marian was
standing i' th' great door o' th' castle, in
her hawking gown o' green velure cloth
laced all with silver cord; her plumed hat
was on her curls, and her hawk, Beryl, on
her fist. And she turned and beheld him.
Ne'er did I see verier light in earth or sky,
than flashed into her face as their eyes met.
And he doffed his hat, and came up beside
her on the step, and saith, with the old
laugh, but gentler, "Well met, comrade."</p>

<p>Now when he called her "comrade,"
'twas as when Jock did call me "sweetheart"
in the days o' our wooing. She
went red as the ribbon in his sleeves; and
when the falcon fretted and shook its bells,
he did put out his hand and stroke it, and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
lo! it was still, and seemed to feel him as
its master. And I wondered all this time
where could be my little lady.</p>

<p>To this day I have ne'er seen so handsome
a man as the young lord. He was
tall and straight as an oak, with curls the
color of frost-touched oak-leaves i' th' sunlight,
and eyes like the amber drink when
men hold it aloft ere quaffing, and his
whole countenance bright and eager, and
narrow like that o' a fox, but without a
fox's cunning. Then he seemed fashioned
to run, and ride, and war, as doth become
all men, whether of high or low estate.</p>

<p>Then went I within to inquire after my
little lady; and Jock, who was become a
footman i' th' castle, did tell me of how he
had seen her set forth to walk i' th' park
an hour gone. So straightway I went in
search of her.</p>

<p>I had gone some six hundred paces
when, at a sudden turning, I came upon
her, where she held a little urchin a-straddle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
of her big deer-hound "Courage." The
child gave chuckles o' delight as he slipped
from side to side, and the sun through the
beech-leaves made their heads as like as
two crown pieces. Even as I was about to
lift up my voice to halloo unto her, lo! my
lord doth part the thick branches, and steps
forth a little behind her, and stands watching
her. And as he did stand there, behold,
a look came o'er his face, that was
stranger than any look I had e'er seen on
th' face of man or of woman, and his eyes
were no more bright and eager, but deep
and soft. Then she turned and went direct
towards him unknowing.</p>

<p>When she was beside him, still laughing
and half out o' breath with balancing
o' th' heavy boy, he saith these two words,
"My lady," and methought there was a
whole year's love-making o' ordinary men
crammed into them. Quoth I to myself:
"Ah, my little lord, so thou hast that trick
with thee! God keep my little ladies! for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
if the tongue be a fire, how must it burn
when such a wit doth wag it!" And I determined
in my heart that by some means
I would warn my little lady of his sweet
speecheries. Yet was I tender towards him
for the sake o' by-gone days. Mayhap,
moreover, his comely face had something
to do with it, for, i' fecks, ne'er saw I a goodlier
countenance on Roundhead or Cavalier.</p>

<p>Now when my lady heard his voice at
her ear, first gives she such a start as doth
a mettlesome filly when a hare jumps out
before it, then stock-still stands she, and her
face whiter than a wind-flower, and her lips
a-tremble as if to speak, but no word comes
from them.</p>

<p>He saith again, "My lady."</p>

<p>I saw by the moving of her lips that she
fashioned the words "My God!" but still
she spoke not. And the child began to
whimper and clutch at her kirtle, for she
had loosened her hold of him, and he feared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
falling off of the big dog. So she put one
arm about him to hold him, but her eyes
were yet upon his lordship.</p>

<p>Then he came and lifted her hand to his
breast, and it lay upon his dark-green doublet,
as a white flower-leaf doth upon grass,
and he saith to her, "Sweetheart, dost thou
not know me?"</p>

<p>All at once, for what, God only knoweth,
she fell a-weeping, and he had her in his
arms. And being some two years a mother,
my care was all for the poor little rogue
on the deer-hound; 'twas as much as I could
do to hold back from running and snatching
him in my arms to soothe his terror.</p>

<p>Howbeit, ere that I could commit this
madness, the frighted babe set up such a
howl as only a man-child can utter, and my
lady turned to him in great haste, and my
lord also did set about comforting him.
Then they walked slowly on, and my lord
held the little lad on one side, and my lady
coaxed him o' th' other. Ever and anon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
my lord would look from the babe to my
lady, and then from my lady to the babe.
And a smile just lifted the corners o' his
mouth, as sometimes a wind will just stir
the leaves ere shaking them as with jollity.
I followed cautiously at some distance, and
by-and-by his lordship said, "How was it
that thou didst not know me, coz? Faith
thou art shot up like a lily i' th' sun, but
lilies are aye lilies, and leaving thee a lily,
I find thee a lily still, though blooming on
a taller stem."</p>

<p>And she answered him: "Yea, cousin,
and oaks are aye oaks, though first they be
saplings, then trees. And in truth I knew
thee by thy voice ere I looked at thee;
but 'twas all so sudden, that i' faith I was
frightened at thee."</p>

<p>And he said, "But thou art glad to see
me?"</p>

<p>And being busy with the child, she answered
him without lifting her head, "Thou
knowest that I am."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>Then did he laugh a little, and saith,
"How should I know, coz? Proof, proof,
I pray thee. Wilt thou not give me the
kiss o' welcome after all these years?"</p>

<p>Now he had not offered to kiss Mistress
Marian. Therefore I waited right curiously
to see what my little lady would say unto
his offer, and Jock having dinned it into
my ears ever since our wedding-day, that
all women were by nature eavesdroppers, I
was of a mind to prove his theory for him;
so I not only listened with all my ears, but
I looked with all my eyes.</p>

<p>My lady waxed first ruddy, then like to
milk, then ruddy again, and she reached
out her hand to him across the hound. "In
truth I will, cousin," quoth she.</p>

<p>He did take the little hand in his, putting
down his other hand softly over it, as
when one holds a frighted bird, and he
looked at her as though he would pierce
her lids with his gaze, for her eyes were
down, and he saith, "Sweetheart, right<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
gladly will I give this pretty hand the kiss
o' an eternal welcome; but methinks thou
hast begged the question. I pleaded to receive
a kiss rather than to bestow one."</p>

<p>And her face was like a bended rose.
Then did he step round quickly beside her,
and once more was the poor babe left in
dire terror o' his life, and he made up a
piteous face, but the dog standing still, he
fell to rattling its collar, and soon waxed
merry with the jingle o' th' silver. So I
looked again at my lady and Lord Radnor.</p>

<p>He had taken her about her waist with
one arm, and with the other hand he lifted
gently upward her fair face, as doth a gardener
a rain-beaten flower, while his eyes
looked down into hers. And slowly, slowly,
almost as rose-leaves unfurl i' th' sun,
her white lids curled upward, and her blue
eyes peered softly from her yellow locks
like corn-flowers through ripe corn, there
being a tear in each, as when a rain-bead
doth tremble i' th' real corn-flowers. And,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
to be the more like nature, there ran big
waves throughout her loosened tresses, like
as when the wind doth steal across a field
o' grain on summer noons.</p>

<p>Then he bended down his tall head, and
their lips met. God alone knows what
their first words would a been, for ere the
kiss was well ended, down falls the poor little
rogue off of the hound's back, and lifts
up his voice loud enow to be heard across
the sea by the red men i' the new continent.
And my lady runs and lifts him in
her arms. Lord! such an ado as they had
a-comforting him! First my lady, then my
lord, then my lady again&mdash;and at last my
lord tosses him to his shoulder, and saith he,</p>

<p>"Ho! thou little Jack Pudding! an thou
art not still o' th' instant, I'll swear thou art
a girl, an' thou shalt ne'er have a sword
such as men have."</p>

<p>And as I live, the child stinted, and
waxed as solemn as an owl! Not another
tear did he shed. My lord saith,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
"Now thou art a good lad, therefore
thou shalt have my sword to play with."
And he unbinds it from his side, scabbard
and all, and holds it while the urchin gets
astride o't and pretends to ride. When my
lord is tired o' stooping, he lifts the child
again to his shoulder, and so do they conduct
him back to his mother, the gardener's
wife. From thence they return to the castle,
and are met by my lord and lady and
all the servants, while I haste me in by a
side door to get on my Sunday kirtle and
appear with the rest.</p>

<p>As time wore on, the three were as much
together as when he was a little lad and
they lassies, and sometimes from a window,
and sometimes from a quiet coigne in the
great hall (this very hall, ye mind, dears), I
would sit with my stitchery and mark them
at their bright chatter.</p>

<p>But often Mistress Marian would come
and sit against my knee, even as thou art
sitting now, sweetheart, and ask me to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
stroke her hair, and when she would coax
Lord Ernle's big blood-hound "Valor" to
come and lie beside her, she would sit more
quiet, almost as though she were asleep.
And she would ask me ever and again,
"Nurse, wherefore are women at any time
born with dark hair, to mar ev'n such small
comeliness as they might otherwise have?"</p>

<p>And always I would answer, "Tut! thou
knowest not of what thou speakest, my
honey; in the sight o' some, dark hair is
more comely than fair hair." And always
she would shake her head, and smile i' th'
fashion o' one who knows better than another.
But she was a wondrous fair woman,
in spite o' her own thinking, and shaped
like the brown metal wench over yonder
with the bow and arrows. Diana, say ye?
Why, even so; so it was that his lordship
called her when he did not call her "comrade."</p>

<p>Now young Sir Rowland Nasmyth (him
who was father to that Sir Rowland who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
wedded your sister the Lady Anne last
Michaelmas, ye mind, dears), he would be
often over for a day, or maybe several
days, at the castle; and all four would ride
a-hawking, or ramble together, two by two,
through the park; or Lord Ernle and Sir
Rowland would play at rackets, and i' fecks
'twas a sight to see 'em at it! One day my
little lady and Sir Rowland (who was a fair
stripling, with curls near the color o' Mistress
Marian's, and eyes the tinting o' the
far sea on a rainy day) did wander off together,
and Mistress Marian and my lord
were left alone, seated on a rude bench under
one o' th' great beech-trees that flank
the hall door. He leaned forward and rested
an elbow on either knee, and did let his
racket swing back and forth between them,
and sat looking down on it. Mistress Marian's
gaze was upon him, but her big hat
made so deep a shadow o'er her eyes withal
that I could not note them clearly. So
stayed they for some moments.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>Then all in a breath did Lord Ernle
start erect and push back his heavy locks
and speak. "Comrade," saith he, "wilt
thou call me an ass for my pains, I wonder,
an I tell thee o' something that is troubling
me sorely?"</p>

<p>She, having in no wise moved from her
first position, and her eyes still in shadow,
saith, "I pray thee say on, Ernle, for such
words as thou hast just spoken to me are
idle."</p>

<p>And he leaned forward and took one of
her long brown hands in his, but 'twas different
from the way in which he had ta'en
my little lady's hand at their first meeting,
and he saith, "Comrade, for thou hast e'er
been my true and loyal comrade, Marian&mdash;sweet
comrade-cousin&mdash;this is the matter
that doth eat my heart. Dost think there
is aught between Patience and that young
coxcomb?"</p>

<p>There came a red mark all across her
brow, as though he had smitten her, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
with her sudden movement her hat had
fallen upon the ground at her feet. And
she put up her hand to her side as if in
pain, but snatched it back quickly. And
for one heart-beat she shut her eyes. My
lord, who had stooped forward to lift her
hat, saw none o' this, and when the hat was
again upon her brow and its shadow over
her face, she seemed the same as ever.
But I knew the shaft was in her heart, and
my heart seemed to feel it, for I loved her
dearly. When he could wait no longer, he
said, "Well, comrade?"</p>

<p>And she spoke, for from the hair that
crowned her to the feet that carried her
she was as brave as any Cavalier that ever
swung sword for the King, and she said,
"Well indeed, cousin, for thee."</p>

<p>He said, "How dost thou mean for
me?"</p>

<p>Then stooped she and gathered a handful
of grass, and held it aloft and opened
her hand, palm downward, that the falling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
blades were blown this way and that by the
wind.</p>

<p>"I mean," quoth she, "that Rowland
Nasmyth is no more to Patience than&mdash;I
am to thee." And she laughed a little.</p>

<p>He came closer to her, and laid his arm
about her shoulders, drawing her to him,
and he said, "Nay, thou knowest how dear
thou art to me, comrade; but thou meanest
in different wise&mdash;is't so?"</p>

<p>She said, "Yea; but call me Marian to-day.
It is to my whim."</p>

<p>He answered, "Dear Marian," and would
have kissed her cheek, but she started up
with a little cry, saying, "By'r lay'kin!
there was a honey-bee tangled in my locks."</p>

<p>And when he had sought for the bee to
kill it with his hat, but could not find it,
they did seat themselves again, he laughing
and saying that "the bee was a bee o' much
discretion and wondrous good taste."</p>

<p>That night when I crept to my little ladies
to see that all was quiet, I, pausing in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
the door-way, did note them as they lay&mdash;my
little lady with her head on Mistress
Marian's breast, and a smile on her lips,
and Mistress Marian with her arms wrapped
close about her, and her dark hair swept
out over the pillow, and thence to the floor,
like a stream o' water that reflects a black
cloud, but her eyes wide open, looking
straight forward, as though at a ghost.
And I stole off and sobbed myself to sleep,
but not before I had awakened Jock, who
did grunt, after the uncourteous, pig-like
manner of a suddenly wakened man, be-thump
his pillow as though 't had been an
anvil, and in turning over, twist the bedclothes
half off of me, so that what with
the cold (it being then the fall o' th' year),
and what with my distress, I slept but uneasily.</p>

<p>And the next thing I knew o' th' matter,
there was a wedding, and my little lady
wedded to Lord Ernle, and Mistress Marian
her bridemaid. Surely if the good God<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
e'er sent happiness on earth, He did send
it to my little lady and to his lordship.
'Twas at this time that Sir Rowland asked
Mistress Marian to be his spouse. And
'twas even i' th' same spot where Lord
Ernle had discovered his love for my little
lady, that he asked her.</p>

<p>Again it was as though some one had
smitten her&mdash;her face deadly white and the
red line across her brow. She put out one
hand to keep him from her, and let it rest
on his shoulder, and she said, "Rowland, I
love thee well, but no man will ever call me
wife."</p>

<p>He said, "Is this the end?"</p>

<p>She said, "Though we should both live
to see the last day, it is the end."</p>

<p>Then he went, with his head bowed
down. And when he was gone, for the first
time in all her life she wept aloud.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Some time passed, and matters waxed
ever hotter and hotter 'twixt Cavaliers and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Roundheads, till one night there rode up a
man to the castle gate with papers for Lord
Ernle, and the long and the short o't was
this: His lordship was ordered to ride forth
to war, and my little lady only three months
his wife. Now when this blow fell upon
them they were all at meat in this very
hall, for ofttimes in cold weather they dined
here, even as thy father and mother do
now, on account o' th' greater warmth.</p>

<p>And when my lord had glimpsed at the
papers he did start to his feet, saying,
"Where is the man who brought these papers?"</p>

<p>Jock answered him, "He is gone, my
lord."</p>

<p>Then snatching up a flagon of wine that
was near at hand, he drank more than half
that was in it. And again he turned over
the papers in his hand. But all they, my
little lady, and Mistress Marian, and your
grandfather and grandmother, seemed turned
to stone. All at once my little lady<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
started up as from a spell, and went and
got her arms about him, as in years gone
by when she had hurt him with his own
mock sword, and she cried out, "What is
it? what is it?" Anon came Mistress Marian
to his other side, and looked over his
shoulder, while he stood between them like
one bewitched, and whiter than a man just
dead. When Mistress Marian noted the
contents o' th' papers, up went her hand to
her heart as on that day under the beech-tree,
and she caught at his arm to stay herself.</p>

<p>He turned from his wife to her as though
for help, saying, "Tell her, tell her, comrade."
And he sank into a chair near by,
and dropped down his head into his hand.</p>

<p>Lord! Lord! that was a fearful night!
When they made my little lady to understand,
she set up one cry after another,
each loud enough to pierce the very floor
of heaven. Ne'er since have I heard a
woman utter such cries as those. And no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
one but Mistress Marian could in any wise
appease her, for she would not have my
lord come unto her, but drove him away
with waving of her hands, saying, "Thou
dost not love <i>me</i>, but the King! thou dost
not love <i>me</i>, but the King!"</p>

<p>And when Mistress Marian sought to
reason with her, 'twas even the same.
Naught could she do but sit and hold her,
and comfort her with soft words and noises
such as mothers make o'er their young
babes. By-and-by she was calmer, and
asked to see her lord. So Mistress Marian
went out, but I remained on a low stool at
the bed's foot. Lord Ernle entered, and
she crept into his arms like a fawn into the
hollow of a rock when the hail is falling.
And they clung to each other in silence.
Presently he saith, "Darling, darling, that
I should have brought thee to grief!"</p>

<p>She answered, "Nay, not thou, but God.
O love, dost truly think that God is aye a
good God?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>And he hushed and soothed her even
more tenderly than did Mistress Marian.</p>

<p>Afterwhile she saith, almost in a whisper,
"But thou needst not go?"</p>

<p>He said, "Darling, how dost thou mean?"</p>

<p>And she whispered more low and said,
"I will go with thee to the new continent
to-morrow, and there we can live the rest
o' our days in peace and love." And she
broke out all at once wilder than ever:
"Ernle! Ernle! take me! I will go with
thee! I will leave father, and mother, and
home, and country, and friends, and King
for thee! Only go not to war! go not to
war!"</p>

<p>He said but two words back of his teeth,
"I must!" and then again, "<i>I must!</i>"</p>

<p>But when he looked at her for answer,
lo! she had swooned away.</p>

<p>He was to set forth in two days after the
morrow; and on the morning of that day,
behold! we could not believe our own eyes
for astonishment when we saw the Lady<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Patience step quietly forth, composed and
gentle, though very pale. She saith good-morrow
to every one, and after a while she
doth slip her arm through her husband's
arm, and saith she, "Come for a walk, Ernle;
I have much to say to thee." So they
started forth together. Now I, fearful of
many things, did follow at a little distance.
As they walked she besought him again
that he would take her and set sail for the
new continent. And when again he told
her how that it could not be, she fell down
upon her knees before him, and clasped him
with her arms, and she said, "If thou dost
not love me, let me be the first to die by
thy sword. Slay me, as I kneel, for the love
I bear thee."</p>

<p>He said, "Patience, Patience, thou wilt
break mine heart."</p>

<p>And she, still kneeling, did cry out with
a wild voice, "They lied who named me,
for in an ill hour was I born, and I have
not patience to support it! I thought that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
thou didst love me, and lo! thou lovest the
husband of another woman more than thou
lovest me!"</p>

<p>He bent to lift her up, groaning, but she
would not; whereat he trembled from head
to foot, and she shook with his trembling
as the leaves of a tree when the shaft is
smitten by lightning. And she cried out
again, and said, "As there is a God in heaven,
thou dost not love me, an thou canst go
to war and leave me to die o' grief." Then,
as though 'twas torn from him, he burst
forth, "Now as there is a God, thou dost
not love <i>me</i>, to torture me thus!"</p>

<p>And all at once she was quiet. So he
stooped and lifted her, and called her his
"bride," and his "wife," and his "darling,"
and his "heart's blood," and more wild, fond,
foolish names than at this day I can remember.
'Twas near sundown, and that
night he was to ride. Over against the
dark jags o' th' hills there ran a narrow
streak of light, like a golden ribbon. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
the brown clouds above and below it were
like locks o' hair made wanton by the wind,
which it as a fillet did seek to bind. But
they twain walked ever on, till by-and-by
they neared that cave o' which I did tell ye.
As they came in front o't my lady turned,
and smiling piteously, "Ernle," saith she,
"wilt thou go with me into the cave and
kiss me there, that when thou art gone I
may come hither and think o' thee?"</p>

<p>And he said, "Oh, my heart! what would
I not for thee?" And he kissed her again
and again.</p>

<p>Presently she said, "Do not think me
foolish, but wilt thou enter first?&mdash;it is so
dark." And she stood in the door-way, with
her hand on the door, while he entered.</p>

<p>He said, "There is nothing here, sweetheart,
but a monstrous damp odor."</p>

<p>And she answered, "Nay, but go to the
very end; there may be toads; and when
thou art there, halloo to me." So she waited
with her hand on the door.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>He called to her, "There is nothing, love.
Wait until I return to thee." But, ere he
had ceased speaking, she clapped to the
door with all her might, and did push forward
the great iron bolt, so that he was a
prisoner in the cave; I being rooted to the
ground with astonishment, as fast as was
ever the oak-tree under which I stood. At
first he thought 'twas but one o' her pretty
trickeries, and I heard his gay laugh as he
came to the shut door, and he called out,
and said, "So, sweetheart, I am in truth a
prisoner o' war; but art thou not an unmerciful
general to confine the captured in
so rheumatic a cavern?"</p>

<p>She sat down and leaned her head against
the door, but said not a word.</p>

<p>And he spoke again, saying, "Darling, I
pray thee waste not what little time doth
yet remain to us."</p>

<p>Still she answered not; and again he
spake, and his voice began to be sorrowful.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, my wife," he said, "canst thou jest
at such a time?"</p>

<p>At last she answered him, saying, "I jest
not."</p>

<p>His voice changed somewhat, and he said,
"What dost thou, then?"</p>

<p>She answered, "I keep what is mine.
Where my forefathers did hide their treasure,
there hide I mine."</p>

<p>He said, in a loud voice, "God will not
suffer it."</p>

<p>Then fell a silence between them. But
by-and-by he spoke again. "Darling," he
saith, "surely thou dost not mean to do this
thing?"</p>

<p>And she saith, like a child when 'tis
naughty, and knoweth well that it is, but
likes not to say so, "What thing?"</p>

<p>He answered, "Thou canst not truly
mean to shut me here to bring dishonor
upon me, who have loved thee better than
man ever loved woman" (for so do all men
say, and truly think).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>She said, "Thy life is more to me than
thy honor."</p>

<p>And he groaned aloud, crying, "Oh God!
that I have lived to hear thee say it!" and
again there fell a silence, save for the whispering
of the night in the trees above us
and the creeping of small creatures through
the dry grass. 'Twas almost curfew-time,
and there was one star in the black front o'
th' night, like the star on the forehead of a
black stallion.</p>

<p>When he spake again his voice was very
fierce, and he saith, "Patience, I do command
thee to release me."</p>

<p>But she spake never a word.</p>

<p>And again he said, "Better let me out to
love thee, than keep me here until I hate
thee."</p>

<p>She shivered, leaning against the door,
until the big bolt rattled in its braces.</p>

<p>And he said yet again, "By the Lord
God, an thou dost keep me here to sully
my good name, and that of thy father and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
mother, who have been to me even as my
own flesh and blood, I will never live with
thee again as man with wife, but will go
forth into the New World to live and to
die with thy handmaid dishonor!"</p>

<p>And she was silent.</p>

<p>Again he spoke, and lifted up his voice
in a cry exceeding sorrowful and bitter, so
that my heart froze to hear it.</p>

<p>"Woman! woman! was it for this I gave
thee my fair fame to cherish? Or was it
for this that I put my name into thy keeping?
Oh, child, listen while there is yet
time! Wilt thou with thy own hands take
his manhood from thy husband to drag
it through the mire? Patience, as I have
shared thy childhood, as I have loved and
cherished thy girlhood, as I have held thee
in my arms as bride and wife, give me back
my honor while there is yet time. Oh, my
wife! my darling!" And I heard him sobbing
like a little lad.</p>

<p>At that sound she put both hands over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
her ears, and started to her feet, looking
from right to left like a hunted thing, and
I could bear it no longer, but leaped forward
and fell on my knees before her, and
grasped her kirtle with both hands. I could
scarce speak for tears, but with all the
strength that was in me did I plead with
her to draw back the bolt, but she would
not. Now to this day when I do think of
the fool that I was, not to run without her
knowledge and bring the old lord, thy grandfather,
or bide my time and unbar the door
when she had gone, it seems as though I
must hate myself for evermore. But as I
pleaded with her, all at once there was something
cold against my throat, and I seemed
to know that 'twas a dagger, and the steel
cowed me, as it doth sometimes cow strong
men, and I stirred not, neither spoke I a
word more. Her face was over me, like a
white flower in the purple dusk, but her
eyes bright and terrible. And when she
spoke, 'twas not my little lady's voice,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
but rather the voice o' a fiend. And she
said,</p>

<p>"Swear that thou sayest nothing of all
this to man, or to woman, or to child, else
will I kill thee as thou kneelest."</p>

<p>And I knew that for the time she was
mad, and would kill me even as she had
said, did I not swear. So I did take that
fearful oath, coward as I was, and to this day
am I a craven when I think on 't. When I
had sworn, she turned from me as though
there were no such woman in all the earth,
and went once more to the door o' th' cave,
and called his name&mdash;"Ernle!"</p>

<p>He answered straightway, and said, "This
once will I speak to thee, but if thou dost
not unbar the door o' th' instant, I will never
hold speech with thee again, nor touch so
much as the hem of thy garments, by the
living God!"</p>

<p>She said, "I cannot! I cannot! But oh!
say not such dreadful words. We will be
happy. 'Tis for that I keep thee here.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Speak to me! Ernle! Ernle! Ernle!
Call me thy love once more! Just once!
just once!"</p>

<p>But she might as well have plead at the
door o' a tomb for all the answer she got.
Again and again she called him, but a dead
man speaks no more than spoke her lord.
And at last she sprang to her feet, and rushed
away into the darkness towards the castle,
and I after her.</p>

<p>And when I was entered in by a side
door, and had changed my apparel and
gone forth to inquire after her, lo! she was
raving as with fever, and all they, her
father, and mother, and Mistress Marian,
thought that he had ridden away and left
her i' th' park, having said farewell to them
ere he and my lady did set forth to walk.
And they strove to comfort her.</p>

<p>The morrow was scarce dawned when she
was up and dressed, and stealing through
the covert to the door o' th' cave. I followed
her, for she heeded me no more, now that I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
had taken the oath, knowing that I would
be torn in pieces ere I would betray my
trust. When she was come to the door,
she kneeled down and leaned her head
against it, and called to him, with a voice
so exquisite low, 'twas almost as though one
should hear the spirit when it speaks within,
and she saith, "Ernle&mdash;my love&mdash;my love."</p>

<p>And all was still as death. And she said,
"Darling, feel with thy hands for the bread
and wine. It is near thee on the right o'
th' door as thou enterest in. Two bottles
o' wine and some loaves o' bread."</p>

<p>But he answered her neither by word
or sighing. And she said, "Wouldst thou
break my heart?" Then, when she saw
that he would not answer her, she cast herself
face down along the ground, and tore
up the grass with her hands, and pressed
down her face into the damp earth. And
after a while (for th' looks o't) she rose and
went back to the castle.</p>

<p>At nightfall there rode a man to the castle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
gate with papers, wherein my Lord Falkland
did question wherefore Lord Radnor
had not answered the summons. And all
they were amazed and looked at one another.
The messenger said, moreover, "If
that it cannot be proven ere to-morrow
night that the Lord Radnor hath been the
victim o' foul play, he will be branded as a
deserter throughout the land."</p>

<p>Thy grandfather gave one cry, "Murdered!"
and the sound of it stilled the life
in me that I fell down as one dead. And
when I had once more come to the possession
o' my wits, Jock did tell me as how
'twas already whispered in the village that
the young lord had deserted the cause, and
had set sail in secret for the New World.
Upon this, I straightway swooned again.
And when I was recovered enough to stand
upon my feet and go forth from my chamber,
behold! there was a silence over all
the house, as in a house where the best beloved
has died in the night.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>Men scoured the country far and near,
in search o' th' murdered body o' th' young
lord. And 'twas now the evening o' th'
third day. But my lady meant not to open
the door until the morrow, for if she opened
it ere then, she knew not but what matters
might be righted, and her lord ride to the
wars in spite o' all. When it was nigh to
sunset she did creep forth and kneel at the
door o' th' cave, and call to him in that beautiful,
gentle voice, "Ernle! Ernle! my love!
my darling!"</p>

<p>And when he did not answer her, she
ceased not, as on the day before, but went
on: "To-morrow I will set thee free. As I
live, thou shall be free to-morrow. An thou
wilt but let me be near thee like thy dog, I
will ask no more. Neither will I fret thee
with my sorrow. Oh, love, I do beseech
thee speak to me, whose only sin was in
loving thee too dearly. Let the kisses that
as a bride I have set upon thy lips plead
with them that they speak to me. Oh, my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
heart! oh, my husband, have pity! If thou
wilt never speak to me again, speak to me
now. Say but my name, my silly, ill-bestowed
name, 'Patience.' Nay, curse me,
so I but hear thy voice. Call me what names
thou wilt. In God's name, Ernle! In the
name o' her who was once thy wife!" And
as she knelt and pleaded as a woman with
her God, behold! there stepped forth from
the coppice Mistress Marian. She stood
there like a figure cut in snow, for her kirtle
was all of white s&eacute;m&eacute;, and her hair was as
a cloud fallen round about her. When she
saw my lady she drew in her breath with a
sharp sound, and set both hands against
her bosom. And she bended forward from
her loins and listened, but in none otherwise
moved she. And my lady went on,
"To-morrow I will set thee free&mdash;I do
swear it. With the rising o' th' morrow's
sun thou shalt be free as air. Only speak
to me now. Only speak to me now. Just
once, Ernle&mdash;just once."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>With one spring Mistress Marian was
upon her, and had pinned her arms to her
sides. And the two women stood and gazed
into each other's faces, with their throats
stretched forward, as serpents stretch their
throats ere springing upon each other.</p>

<p>Mistress Marian spake first, and her voice
was as a voice that I had never heard, and
she said, "So <i>this</i> is the truth, then?"</p>

<p>My lady said no word, but her eyes were
aflame.</p>

<p>And Mistress Marian gazed on her for
an instant more, then dashed her aside, and
turned towards the cave.</p>

<p>"Ernle," she said, "take heart. I will set
thee free&mdash;I, Marian!" But ere her hand
did touch the bolt, my lady was upon her
like a little tiger, and she wound her hands
in Mistress Marian's thick tresses, and
dragged her backward.</p>

<p>And they rolled over and over on the
ground, even as do men when they fight,
saying no word from first to last. The horror<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
of it smote me that I fell down upon my
knees and was dumb. Now my little lady
was uppermost, now Mistress Marian. And
had not my lady been strong with despair,
Mistress Marian could 'a' mastered her o'
th' instant. But she fought like a she-wolf
brought to bay, with teeth and talons too,
and 'twas almost as though two of a size
had fought there. Howbeit, with a sudden
move, Mistress Marian flung my lady down,
and set her knee upon her, and held her, and
looked from side to side, as though at a loss,
and my lady's strength was fast failing.</p>

<p>When I saw that, I could bide still no
longer, but ran forward, crying to Mistress
Marian to be gentle with her.</p>

<p>She answered but these words, "Nurse,
take off my girdle and bind thy lady's hands
with it." And there was that in her voice
I dared not disobey. So I bound my lady's
hands, she saying never a word, and when
the girdle was fast knotted, Mistress Marian
helped her gently enough to rise, and bidding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
me have a care o' her, turned and
drew back the bolt from the door o' the
cave.</p>

<p>The last light o' the sun fell like a golden
lance across the threshold, and across my
lord as he lay there, face down, with his
hands against the sill o' th' door.</p>

<p>And she stooped down over him, saying,
"He hath fainted for lack o' food," but I
knew that there was both wine and bread i'
th' cave. And she called his name, but he
was silent. And she called him again and
again. And at last she bade me come to
her side, and when we had turned him upon
his side so that his face was towards us, behold,
he was dead. But Mistress Marian
saith again, "He hath swooned away." And
she put her hand upon his brow, but no sooner
did she touch it than she cried out at its
coldness, and shook the dead man in her
frenzy, crying,</p>

<p>"Ernle! Ernle! thou art free! Wake,
man! thou art free!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>I said, "Mistress, mistress, for love of
God! Dost thou not see that neither thou
nor any other can wake him more?"</p>

<p>Thereat she fell back upon her knees,
leaning upon one arm. And she said,
"Dost thou mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>I bowed down mine head, for I could not
meet her eyes. And she fell upon his body,
and stirred no more, so that when they came
to bear the poor young lord to the castle,
they did bear her also. And for some hours
we thought her dead.</p>

<p>Now when my lady saw them how they
lay there, and the sunlight red upon them
like to blood, she came and kneeled down
in front o' me, and lifted up her poor fettered
hands meekly, like a little child. And
she said, "Nurse, I pray you tell me what it
doth mean, for methinks I am waxing foolish,
like poor Marjory i' th' village whose
man fell from the cliff."</p>

<p>I could not answer her for sobbing.</p>

<p>And she said, "Do they sleep?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>And I nodded my head, for I could say
no word.</p>

<p>She said, "Pray you, do not wake them.
An they sleep till the morrow, all will be
well." Suddenly her wits came back upon
her with a rush, as doth a wind that hath
seemed to be gone for aye. And she snapt
the girdle on her wrists like as it had been
a thread o' silk, and ran and laid hold on
him with her hands, and dragged him forth
upon the grass. And she saith,</p>

<p>"Ernle! Ernle! Ernle! What! wilt thou
not answer me, now that thou art free?
See! thou mayest ride to war. It is not
yet too late. What there, nurse! My lord's
charger! Run! run!" Then leaped she to
her feet with one cry that methought would
'a' cracked the welkin in twain above our
heads.</p>

<p>"Dead! Oh God in heaven!"</p>

<p>So for an instant she stood, with her
arms reached high above her head, and her
eyes upon him as he lay at her feet, even as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
a flame doth poise for a breath ere sinking
again upon the coals. But anon she dropped
down beside him, and beat her forehead with
the lower palms o' her hands, and she saith,
"Well didst thou sign me with thy blood!
well didst thou sign me with thy blood!"
Then all at once did she peep up at me over
her shoulder with one o' her winsome ways,
and fell a-laughing softly.</p>

<p>"Nurse," saith she, "hath he not found a
pretty way to punish me? He feigns it well&mdash;by'r
lay'kin&mdash;doth he not, nurse?"</p>

<p>And she rocked to and fro, as she knelt
beside him, laughing softly to herself, and
ever and again she would reach forth one
little hand, all scarred in her struggle with
Mistress Marian, and would touch a stray
lock into place, and once she bent over and
kissed him, laughing softly, and nodding to
herself very wisely. And she would sit that
way, and rock herself to and fro, and smile
upon the ground, and laugh softly, until the
very day that she did die. And the last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
words that she did ever say were, "Just
once, Ernle&mdash;just once."</p>

<p>(Nurse Crumpet rises and stirs the fire,
amid a heavy silence, broken only by the
little Lady Dorothy's sobs and the rushing
of the wind outside the great hall.)</p>

<h2>TONY, THE MAID.</h2>

<div class='center'>A Novelette. <span class="smcap">By Blanche Willis Howard.</span> Illustrated
by <span class="smcap">Charles S. Reinhart</span>. 16mo, Cloth, $1&nbsp;00.</div>


<div class="blockquot"><p>"'Tony, the Maid,' is not only one of the best pieces of work Miss
Howard has yet done, but it is one of the very best short stories of the
year. Tony herself is an original creation. There is no maid like
Tony in all fiction; and she is, moreover, the only good thing, which
is neither superlatively beautiful nor emphatically a bore, or both, that
has come out of the Canton of Lucerne since the days of William Tell.
Even the insatiate archer, when he is not mythical, is a trifle wearing
to the average mind, but Tony is never tiresome and always grand.</p>

<p>"As a short story Miss Howard's 'Tony, the Maid' has but one
fault. It is too short. There is not enough of Tony. She makes her
exit too suddenly and too completely. It is consoling to know, however,
that Miss Zschorcher is some day coming to America as Mrs.
Eduard Maler. Perhaps Tony the Maid may figure as Tony the Matron
and Tony the Mother. Knowing her duty to her gracious Fr&auml;ulein,
no doubt she will."</p>

<p>A bright and lively sketch of an American woman abroad, and characterized
throughout by keen and forcible phraseology and a very
symmetrical construction.&mdash;<i>N. Y. Commercial Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>This is a very clever satire on one of the phases of modern society,
and the tale is told in a most charming manner.&mdash;<i>Albany Press.</i></p>

<p>It is a long time since we have met with anything so charming, so
refreshing, so droll.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Read this book once, and one wants to turn
back and read it again.&mdash;<i>N. Y. Star.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Reinhart's illustrations greatly enhance the interest of the novelette.&mdash;<i>Buffalo
Commercial Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>A story written in a style as simple as that which Miss Howard has
adopted in this novelette is sure to find many readers. The story is
well told and attractive.&mdash;<i>Troy Press.</i></p>

<p>"Tony, the Maid," is safe for a great success with the lovers of the
bright and dainty in literature. It is prettily bound, and uncommonly
cleverly illustrated.&mdash;<i>N. Y. Graphic.</i></p>

<p>The story is told with infinite humor and with not a little pathos,
and it will well repay perusal.&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Telegraph.</i></p>

<p>The plot is new, the characters are fresh, and the handling is spirited
and brisk. No one who commences this little book will stop reading
until the end is reached.&mdash;<i>Chicago Journal.</i></p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>There is a certain bright cheerfulness in Miss Woolson's writing
which invests all her characters with lovable qualities.&mdash;<i>Jewish Advocate,
N. Y.</i></p>

<p>Miss Woolson is among our few successful writers of interesting
magazine stories, and her skill and power are perceptible in the delineation
of her heroines no less than in the suggestive pictures of
local life.&mdash;<i>Jewish Messenger, N. Y.</i></p>

<p>Constance Fenimore Woolson may easily become the novelist
laureate.&mdash;<i>Boston Globe.</i></p>

<p>Miss Woolson has a graceful fancy, a ready wit, a polished style, and
conspicuous dramatic power; while her skill in the development of a
story is very remarkable.&mdash;<i>London Life.</i></p>

<p>Miss Woolson never once follows the beaten track of the orthodox
novelist, but strikes a new and richly loaded vein, which so far is all
her own; and thus we feel, on reading one of her works, a fresh sensation,
and we put down the book with a sigh to think our pleasant
task of reading it is finished. The author's lines must have fallen to
her in very pleasant places; or she has, perhaps, within herself the
wealth of womanly love and tenderness she pours so freely into all
she writes. Such books as hers do much to elevate the moral tone of
the day&mdash;a quality sadly wanting in novels of the time.&mdash;<i>Whitehall
Review, London.</i></p></div>
